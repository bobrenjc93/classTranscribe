# ClassTranscribe FAQ For New Instructors 

## What is the purpose of ClassTranscribe?

The soundbite - "Accessible, Searchable, Linkable lecture videos!"

ClassTranscribe is an open-source, web-based platform being developed by students and faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. It uses automatic latest speech-to-text transcription and crowdsourcing to address the problem of accurate, reliable and fast and searchable transcriptions of college lectures. Completed transcriptions provide text-search functionality that augments existing lecture recordings and enable enhanced educational features including closed captioning. 

We are working with accessibility specialists and students to ensure to make ClassTranscribe one of the best online lecture that is accessible.
