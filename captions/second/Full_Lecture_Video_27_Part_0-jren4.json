[{"text":"alright","width":192},{"text":"good afternoon everybody","width":106},{"text":"and welcome to friday yay","width":113},{"text":"so here we go","width":56},{"text":"heres what were going to do today","width":99},{"text":"is were going to talk about file systems and how files are represented","width":264},{"text":"but I also wanted to let you know about a cool new project","width":208},{"text":"that we're getting started","width":87},{"text":"and I'd like you to be part of it","width":91},{"text":"so I apologize for the spam but","width":215},{"text":"here's why I think its really cool","width":151},{"text":"wouldn't it be nice if you could go back to a lecture and say","width":188},{"text":"uh yeah uhh what was he saying when he talked about this term or that term","width":356},{"text":"which lecture was it in when","width":124},{"text":"the instructor or lecturer mentioned x y z","width":199},{"text":"so thats the idea is so can we transcribe lectures","width":246},{"text":"recorded lectures","width":75},{"text":"and then make subtitles?","width":199},{"text":"for people with strong english accents like myself?","width":137},{"text":"and for searching as well","width":178},{"text":"so for example","width":84},{"text":"remember those 241 videos that I made for the beginning of the course?","width":399},{"text":"supposed you wanted to find all the lectures where I mentioned printf()","width":249},{"text":"so we can kind of google search it and in real time find it","width":207},{"text":"oh yeah thats the one I wanted","width":165},{"text":"and you click on this and ","width":301},{"text":"my machine seems to be a bit slow today","width":107},{"text":"probably because its friday","width":213},{"text":"and off it goes and uh we can review the concepts","width":197},{"text":"so we've done that now for those mini videos","width":317},{"text":"and now I want to do that for 241 content","width":301},{"text":"and then we're going to take over the world","width":141},{"text":"the plan is to make it successful in this course and then say to the college why don't we do this for other courses as well inside the collge","width":445},{"text":"I'm already trying to make ways to prepare the lectures to say hey you know your course is recorded","width":381},{"text":"hey you could do so much more.","width":104},{"text":"lets make it successful inside 241 first","width":186},{"text":"so heres the plan","width":23},{"text":"we take a one hour video and we divide it into chunks","width":202},{"text":"short say 7 minute chunks","width":108},{"text":"and then you just take a short amount of time to type it in","width":256},{"text":"there is a second pass where you take those phrases someone else has done and you make sure they're lined up to the right part of the video","width":447},{"text":"its very easy work and we think it might might actually improve your grade","width":208},{"text":"because you're spending time on tasks because you're actually reviewing the content","width":281},{"text":"so thats the idea","width":111},{"text":"thats the promise","width":55},{"text":"lets see if it happens","width":64},{"text":"so please consider signing up and to help uh feel good about doing this","width":438},{"text":"um","width":14},{"text":"myself and another professor from Beckman","width":255},{"text":"we're going to throw in 50 dollars of our own cash each time","width":277},{"text":"so we have 100 dollars each time","width":97},{"text":"and we'll have a little lottery for each person for the people who are actually helping to do this","width":333},{"text":"so there's a small chance reward","width":147},{"text":"maybe you should use the 100 dollars to buy more lottery tickets and upscale it onto a million","width":323},{"text":"we'll see","width":36},{"text":"right so anyway thats that","width":78},{"text":"and i'm afraid those rewards are only available to cs 241 students at this time","width":283},{"text":"okay so thats class transcribe","width":176},{"text":"lets make this big lets make it big enough that we can crowdsource this","width":233},{"text":"and make it so that it actually even works for other universities as well","width":304},{"text":"okay right so back to today's content","width":210},{"text":"oops I had an overhead","width":401},{"text":"right class","width":31},{"text":"here's what were going to do","width":81},{"text":"I'm going to ask you now with a neighbor or imaginary friend of your choice","width":301},{"text":"to come up with some design goals for what you would like to see in a file system","width":390},{"text":"so you won't be the first person to invent their own file system.","width":213},{"text":"its been done done by times before","width":135},{"text":"but what are your criteria?","width":182},{"text":"what would you like to put inside your file system?","width":149},{"text":"supposed we said oh your senior project is to make new filesystem","width":309},{"text":"how should we measure it?","width":50},{"text":"what are the high level designs","width":93},{"text":"don't give me implementation details like","width":219},{"text":"oh I want to hash everything. I want to cache it.","width":168},{"text":"No. Give me some high level things","width":152},{"text":"What are your kind of selling points","width":95},{"text":"What are your requirements for what makes a good file system","width":228},{"text":"so take 5 to 10 minutes with a neighbor or imaginary friend and write down some of those criteria","width":479},{"text":"[people writing down the criteria]","width":2877},{"text":"okay","width":29},{"text":"[someone talking in background]","width":8860},{"text":"ok so","width":47},{"text":"lets make a list!","width":129},{"text":"what ideas it says pick ","width":222},{"text":"no lets not pick","width":64},{"text":"lets have some volunteers","width":119},{"text":"what ideas what are our design goals then","width":138},{"text":"shoot give me one","width":362},{"text":"yes","width":217},{"text":"you want it hiearchical ","width":123},{"text":"you just want me try to spell that word. ok","width":172},{"text":"alright so we want it hierarchical, what else?","width":241},{"text":"[someone talking]","width":403},{"text":"ok. we efficiently use our storage space so we might need to keep a map of which areas we're using and which areas we're not using","width":527},{"text":"ok what else","width":157}]
