[{"text":"[Intro]","width":501},{"text":"Okay so despite all odds it looks like we'll actually be able to start on time today.","width":426},{"text":"Despite multiple printers conspiring against me to make sure that we don't start the on time.","width":368},{"text":"So.. quick pop quiz to check if you retained all of last lecture: what is the name and major of the person sitting next to you?","width":532},{"text":"Just kidding.","width":71},{"text":"So.. the important parts of that were sort of at the end of that lecture so we're gonna go revisit the make file in particular and do a little bit of a sample exercise just to make sure that sunk in.","width":668},{"text":"But first, I did fix my script so now I actually have the prelecture responses","width":320},{"text":"from prelecture one and prelecture two so I'm just gonna quickly go over some of those.","width":384},{"text":"[nothing]","width":242},{"text":"Where can we learn more about using make?","width":111},{"text":"So we'll talk more about make a little bit today","width":167},{"text":"If you're still thirsting for knowledge about make after today's lecture","width":415},{"text":"If you go on the course website and click on the resources tab","width":256},{"text":"There should be a link to a makefile tutorial which is pretty good","width":229},{"text":"I know that there are many different online resources for learning make.","width":299},{"text":"But there is also a video that I made years ago that is halfway decent","width":262},{"text":"That you can see.","width":89},{"text":"That focuses purely on make.","width":128},{"text":"And there is also a video by another person from course staff.. I think [Will Setchel?]","width":256},{"text":"That sort of gives you a little bit more of an intuition about","width":256},{"text":"what rules and dependencies are.","width":256},{"text":"[unknown] and dependencies are","width":128},{"text":"[nothing[","width":422},{"text":"We're going to apply object oriented programming principles on every assignment throughout the course","width":295},{"text":"Pretty much","width":75},{"text":"That doesn't mean that we'll be using every feature of object oriented programming","width":192},{"text":"but typically we're going to wrap up our data structures into some kind of object","width":234},{"text":"Which sort of means that we're using object oriented programming.","width":170},{"text":"[nothing]","width":277},{"text":"Will there an A+ for the class?","width":114},{"text":"I don't see... so A+ is my discretion like I said in the first lecture.","width":256},{"text":"[nothing]","width":384},{"text":"Prevalent are the concepts from CS173 in the class.","width":162},{"text":"Anything specifically that you should know?","width":115},{"text":"Treat homework zero as a diagnostic tool for that.","width":192},{"text":"Homework zero should be not overly difficult.","width":320},{"text":"It should be just a matter of kind of dusting off your discrete math knowledge","width":286},{"text":"Maybe pulling out your textbook and refreshing your brain.","width":189},{"text":"[it shouldn't be] incredibly difficult.","width":128},{"text":"The most important things from 173 that I can think of...","width":267},{"text":"If I had to pick one single topic from 173 that you should be super comfortable with that we're going to use [inaudible]","width":419},{"text":"algorithm analysis in the entire class","width":143},{"text":"That would be induction","width":134},{"text":"So you should be able to prove ","width":128},{"text":"Do proof by induction","width":64},{"text":"and be able to prove things using induction","width":128},{"text":"kind of understand what is a base case","width":164},{"text":"whats the recursive step?","width":72},{"text":"whats an inductive hypothesis?","width":80},{"text":"That sort of thing","width":66},{"text":"Thats kind of the most important thing","width":128},{"text":"And then just general sort of...","width":246},{"text":"feeling comfortable about sums and log properties and that sort of thing will be helpful later too.","width":356},{"text":"[nothing]","width":295},{"text":"Do you have to use a terminal for C++?","width":137},{"text":"No","width":107},{"text":"If you've heard of xcode, you can write c++ in xcode","width":280},{"text":"and thats a nice editor thats for OSX","width":256},{"text":"If you've heard of Microsoft Visual Studio thats another IDE for C++","width":320},{"text":"That doesn't use the terminal at all","width":142},{"text":"So you can definitely write C++ without using...","width":192},{"text":"without being on a Linux terminal.","width":168},{"text":"In this course we will do everything in the Linux terminal however.","width":237},{"text":"Just because its easier to have a single environment for everything","width":276},{"text":"And be able to teach you using one set of tools.","width":164},{"text":"That being said you will have some success...","width":128},{"text":"You should have some success running the assignments on a OSX based computer","width":322},{"text":"If you have xcode in the command line of ","width":267},{"text":"Windows users... your best bet is to use either the","width":265},{"text":"remote EWS machines","width":118},{"text":"So SSH in using puddy or using FastX","width":270},{"text":"If you go on the EngineeringIT website you should be able to find pointers for those.","width":320},{"text":"[nothing]","width":113},{"text":"I think there should be links on the resources page but since the CITES wiki [inaudible]","width":304},{"text":"[nothing]","width":214},{"text":"[unknown] do that today.","width":145},{"text":"[nothing]","width":270},{"text":"This was an interesting question.","width":223},{"text":"This is a question about \"auto\"","width":153},{"text":"So figuring out...","width":59},{"text":"So remember auto is that keyword that you used if you don't want to write your type","width":192},{"text":"and you want C++ to kind of figure out what the type of the right hand side expression is","width":192},{"text":"And so somebody asked a question:","width":86},{"text":"What if I have int m int n and then auto x = n / m?","width":384},{"text":"I'm dividing two integers","width":128},{"text":"Does C++ know to make that auto variable be a double?","width":308},{"text":"No","width":32},{"text":"Unfortunately not.","width":67},{"text":"In general if you're dividing two integers you're always gonna get back an integer.","width":280},{"text":"So if you wanted to make sure that you're getting a double you would have to explicitly cast one of the integer arguments into a double","width":378},{"text":"Or assign it into a temporary double and then use that as part of the calculation","width":256},{"text":"But thats a good question because that maybe is not obvious what happens if you're dividing two integers and you use [auto]","width":297},{"text":"[nothing]","width":240},{"text":"Its actually true even if you said double double double k = n / m","width":256},{"text":"where n and m are integers","width":105},{"text":"Its still going to give you an integer value and then assign the integer to value into a double","width":217},{"text":"So not actually going to give floating point value","width":129},{"text":"[nothing]","width":285},{"text":"In the video it said that after you compile","width":197},{"text":"object files using -c so you have clang++","width":188},{"text":"std = whatever","width":116},{"text":"stdlib = whatever","width":116},{"text":"-c name of file","width":256},{"text":"We output object files","width":106},{"text":"And then you said that we needed to fill in blanks.","width":68},{"text":"When does the filling in the blanks happen?","width":128},{"text":"Thats the linking step.","width":107},{"text":"Compiling with -c makes your object files","width":172},{"text":"The object files are sort of incomplete.","width":107},{"text":"They are machine level instructions but they are missing some parts.","width":167},{"text":"The linking step is what links everything together","width":196},{"text":"and sort of fills in okay...","width":128},{"text":"I actually know where that lives now","width":128},{"text":"Its over at this part of the binary","width":64},{"text":"and I know where that lives. Its over there.","width":128},{"text":"It ties everything back together so that you actually have the full complete program.","width":256},{"text":"The linking step is that.","width":128},{"text":"You may have a compiler error when making an object file.","width":256},{"text":"Or you might have a compiler error when you're linking.","width":192},{"text":"There are compiler errors when you're making the actual","width":256},{"text":"machine code for functions or for a class when we get to classes.","width":256},{"text":"Or linking errors when it can't fill in the gaps.","width":320},{"text":"If maybe you declared a function and then never defined it.","width":295},{"text":"So then it would be a linking error because it knows","width":256},{"text":"You've promised me that there's gonna be this function with this signature.. somewhere.","width":206},{"text":"And then failed to tell me where.","width":149},{"text":"So that would be a linking error.","width":111},{"text":"So its sort of","width":64},{"text":"Even within compilation there's kind of two steps","width":147},{"text":"There's this generating the code and then there's this linking.","width":178},{"text":"[nothing]","width":398},{"text":"So somebody asked a question about is there any information missing over the summer","width":275},{"text":"compared to the regular semester?","width":128},{"text":"A little tiny amount","width":96},{"text":"I try to keep as much as I possibly can in for better or worse.","width":256},{"text":"Because it does have to be the same the class.","width":128},{"text":"But we don't touch on B-Trees","width":192},{"text":"[nothing]","width":125},{"text":"If you're curious about B-Trees you can look those up","width":157},{"text":"at that point we just don't have time to really delve into that","width":192},{"text":"And the regular course I don't think does them","width":128},{"text":"Or at least","width":64},{"text":"The regular course as of a year or two ago still didn't really do them justice anyway","width":320},{"text":"Its not really that big of a loss I don't think.","width":192}]
