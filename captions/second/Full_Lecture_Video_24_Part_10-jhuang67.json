So the probability that I find something is not occupied is 1 minus that.","width":384},{"text":"So the the probability that I find an empty cell is 1 minus alfa.","width":320},{"text":"Alfa is N over M.","width":128},{"text":"Oaky?","width":128},{"text":"Once I have this,I know that the number of trials until I get a success is distributed as geometric. ","width":1088},{"text":"Distribution with parameters p","width":320},{"text":"Okay?","width":128},{"text":"So the expected number of trials is going to be 1/p.","width":576},{"text":"So the expected ...if you just look up sort of what's the expected value if i tell you the geometric distribution models the number of the coin flips you have to do until you get a heads and I'm say our head is an empty cell. Then our cell's probability is 1 minus alfa .","width":960},{"text":"The expected number of things you have to do until you get a success happens to be 1 over p.","width":384},{"text":"So for us this is 1 over 1 minus alfa.","width":384},{"text":"Okay.","width":192},{"text":" That's the expected number of probes that I'm going to do.","width":256},{"text":"Okay?","width":192},{"text":"So again the important point here is that if alfa is held constant ...right if alfa is like 0.7...alright?","width":960},{"text":"Then the expected number of probes is some fixed constant.","width":256},{"text":"Okay?","width":128},{"text":"I don't know what it is.","width":192},{"text":"Some fixed number.Couple. Few. Nothing big. Okay?","width":320},{"text":"As long as I hold up a constant .Holding alfa constant is super important.","width":256},{"text":"Okay?","width":128},{"text":"Now it turns out this analysis is not exactly realistic because  assumed every single probe was independent . ","width":576},{"text":"And we sort of know that's not true.","width":128},{"text":"If you probed and you found an unoccupied cell, you are more likely to find an occupied cell after that.","width":384},{"text":"Because this thing tend to cluster together.","width":64},{"text":"Okay?","width":256},{"text":"More collisions begets more collisions because thing occupies other cells the thing want to be in so you sort of get this nasty behavior which is called primal clustering.  ","width":896},{"text":"[writing]","width":64},{"text":"So the assumption that these things are actually independent is kind of not true.","width":768},{"text":"And you can do a significantly more complicated,cray analysis to actually get this when you aren't making this broke independence assumption.  ","width":640},{"text":"And the prove is significantly more complicated than is coverable in this class.I'll just give you the result.","width":448},{"text":"which is this.","width":192},{"text":"Okay.","width":384},{"text":"Don't memorize that it's not important. ","width":128},{"text":"What is important about this?","width":256},{"text":"What can say about that if alfa is a constant?","width":256},{"text":"This is some constant .","width":128},{"text":"That's the important part. So even if you do the correct analysis and you're not just assuming independence ,because these thing aren't independence.You still get a expected number of probes for en insertion that is something like this. ","width":1088},{"text":"Okay.Where if alfa is constant, the expected probes is constant.","width":448},{"text":"Okay?","width":64},{"text":"And that's that sort of determining the running time .","width":384},{"text":"Right? Our running time is sort of determined by how many probes we have to do.Right?","width":256},{"text":"If we are doing an insert, the thing that took times is locating that empty cell,right?","width":256},{"text":"Running the hash function, modding the size was all constant times. So the only thing that took me times was to find the open cell.","width":448},{"text":"So if I'm doing an insert and I know my load factor is always been held constant ,I can say that my insert time is amortized constant.","width":704},{"text":"On average, the expected number of probes I don't say anything about the worst case number of probes,I said the expected number of probes is constant,right? ","width":448},{"text":"And then the other thing that I amortized here is the table resizing ,right?","width":448},{"text":"I need to still be resizing when my load factor is bad.","width":128},{"text":"Could alfa ever be greater than 1?","width":192},{"text":"For this?","width":64},{"text":"No,right?","width":256},{"text":"I don't have bucket. I don't have the ability to have more ...I can't have n bigger than m.I only have m spots,right?","width":512},{"text":"So alfa is always be something smaller than 1,typically it will be like 0.7,0.6,0.8 something like that.","width":448},{"text":"Okay?","width":64},{"text":"Right sort of similarly , that rest of these are also going to be amortized constant because  they only sort of depend on the number of probes that we are doing,okay?","width":512},{"text":"So this is also going to be amortized constant. And this is going to be amortized constant.","width":448},{"text":"I will stop here. You will write a lot of these in the lab. Remember when you resize you always have to rehash that's true in these case .","width":896}]
