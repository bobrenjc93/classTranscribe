[{"text":"Student asking questions...","width":704},{"text":"ahhh..maybe a little. I think that has little to do with abstract based class I think","width":256},{"text":"more to do with segmenting the part to begin and to different object. I guess you cant test them individually.","width":512},{"text":"right again I am not gonna have a game class that have everything. I am gonna separate class for everything else. and make sure it does the right thing","width":640},{"text":"and sort of compose them together to build a larger system that has","width":384},{"text":"with the object running a programming and has less to do with the abstract part of the...","width":320},{"text":"ahhh.","width":576},{"text":"are the private variables in the base class public to the derived class?","width":576},{"text":"I've got a class base private int acts","width":576},{"text":"and I've got a classed derived as public base... is the private base available for to derive to use?","width":576},{"text":"no. its still privte.","width":128},{"text":"So how do I make it so that the derived class could still use it but the outside world can't?","width":384},{"text":"Protected.","width":64},{"text":"good! ","width":448},{"text":"ah......","width":512},{"text":"there are too many sentences in the prelectures. ok ","width":512},{"text":"silence....","width":384},{"text":"alright this is a good point. so ","width":384},{"text":"do we only need to use virtual net in a header file and not in the notation file?","width":192},{"text":"Ah yes","width":128},{"text":"The virtual goes when you first declare it.","width":128},{"text":"but not when you define it.","width":64},{"text":"Only need to say virtual ","width":192},{"text":"I think you cant say virtual in the implementation plant.","width":192},{"text":"and you are gonna mark something as virtual its gotta be in that file","width":320},{"text":"Silence.......","width":1280},{"text":"if its ... almost. it will be stuff. ","width":448},{"text":"so in terms of kindda like a exam coverage yesish. I am probably not gonna finish them today I will wrap on monday","width":320},{"text":"ah.. in terms of like are we done on c++ material? Not quite","width":384},{"text":"There will be a few things that will show up as for during days","width":320},{"text":"For the most part. Yes.","width":128},{"text":"for the most part you now know the mast majority of the syntactic construct that we are gonna use for the rest of ...","width":448},{"text":"Right, So lets jump in.","width":384},{"text":"so just as a quick review quick warm up problem","width":256},{"text":"lets write a trampled swap function that takes two things of the same type and swap them","width":448},{"text":"and we wanna make this as efficient as possible ","width":256},{"text":"so we need to use whatever c++ 11 features you've got available to us","width":256},{"text":"then we wanna take a stab at the writing the main swap function here","width":256},{"text":"silence...","width":896},{"text":"So this is gonna be able to swap two things of the same type.","width":320},{"text":"but the type could be anything right?","width":128},{"text":"so you must know this must be a templated function.","width":192},{"text":"or a function template because we are gonna fill in what that type is later","width":256},{"text":"The template T meaning that T is going to be a type that we then fill in later","width":960},{"text":"so when the compiler goes to  extensiate this funciton its gonna replace T as a type","width":320},{"text":"Maybe int, maybe double maybe fook, maybe swallow maybe animal maybe bear.
