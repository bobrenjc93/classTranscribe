[{"text":"[Announcements]","width":7997},{"text":"okay, let's go ahead and get started","width":211},{"text":"so, there was no prelecture for today, so no panicking about that, okay","width":320},{"text":"There will be one for tomorrow","width":163},{"text":"depending on how far I get today","width":64},{"text":"there will probably be one for tomorrow, I'll let you know based on how far we get today","width":354},{"text":"because if we don't get far enough it won't make sense","width":192},{"text":"okay, as far as announcements go, lab inheritence grading, I fixed that, so there was a problem with all of it and everybody got a 255/100 which is not at all correct","width":640},{"text":"because they got -1 and -1 becomes 255 apparently","width":226},{"text":"so, that was user error on my part, I fixed that, so those are updated in both the gradebook as well as the SVN, so you can go ahead and check that","width":640},{"text":"Homework 0, I actually got around to actually uploading to gradebook, so please check the gradebook to make sure that matches what you got on your homework","width":448},{"text":"if it's not there, like if it's not in the graded part of that visualization, right, there's this bar, that's like, here's your current score, and then there's all this other stuff that's like \"here's the future\"","width":576},{"text":"If your homework 0 is still in the future part, that means it didn't get input","width":252},{"text":"so either it never got graded, or something else happened","width":256},{"text":"so if that is the case, if you Homework 0 doesn't have a grade in there or it doesn't match, please let your lab TA know, and then we'll figure grade based on the Subversion copy assuming it was submitted on time.","width":832},{"text":"Just double check that, make sure that's all in order, and then if not, bug your lab TA in lab.","width":320},{"text":"Lab tomorrow is going to be for exam review","width":576},{"text":"I haven't asked the instructors for the labs to prepare anything, so go to that prepared to ask questions about stuff that you don't get","width":384},{"text":"Or practice problems that you weren't sure of the answers on or whatever","width":256},{"text":"I aim for those to be more student driven than instructor driven, so it's not they're gonna have a worksheet ready for you to pound through or whatever","width":512},{"text":"So please come to that prepared","width":128},{"text":"Okay, there was some constrination about lab debug because people were printing out stuff, and printing out stuff is good, except for when you do it like eleventy-bajillion times in a loop","width":768},{"text":"and then it takes longer than a thousand milliseconds for your test case to run because you're printing out so much stuff","width":576},{"text":"So a lot of people who were doing that ended up getting like 40s or 60s or whatever on lab debug because it timed out the autograder","width":384},{"text":"because the autograder sets a limited amount of time that you're allowed to run and if you weren't printing anything you should've been fine, but people printed out too much stuff.","width":576},{"text":"So I'm going to allow a late submission for that as of 11pm tonight","width":320},{"text":"so if you're one of those people who you know was printing out all this stuff, and you got, you know, not 100 on lab debug, you should be able to just go and easy commit, right, remove the couts.","width":640},{"text":"And then I'll regrade it again tonight","width":203},{"text":"because that's sort of not your fault.","width":127},{"text":"In the future however, be careful, make sure that you're, you know, you're not doing anything inside of your code that's going to slow it down when the autograder is running,","width":512},{"text":"because there's a limited amount of time that your code gets to execute during the unit tests.","width":320},{"text":"If you look at the output that you have if you're one of these people, you'll see \"timed out\"","width":384},{"text":"There's a timer that starts as soon as the code starts running and it runs for that long and if it's not done it kills it and you get a zero on that particular test case, okay?","width":576},{"text":"So, make sure that you're not printing out eleventy-bajillion things in a loop, or like allocating a png of 1000 by 1000 every iteration of some loop somewhere, okay","width":704},{"text":"You need to make your code be efficient as well because these do have a limited amount of time to run","width":320},{"text":"Most of the time, the provided test cases should take care of that, I'm surprised that they didn't here, so that's why I'm offering this regrade.","width":640},{"text":"In the future, I won't. So make sure that you're doing sane things in your code so that you're not slowing it down unnecessarily","width":512},{"text":"Okay, exam 1 is Wednesday at 7, right","width":448},{"text":"again, there are practice exams and practice problems on the course website, there's a set of topics there that your should look at, I've also sort of tried to mention where I think particularly that those practice exams aren't sufficient, so things like copy and swap, move semantics, rvalue references, these sort of things are kinda not covered on those practice exams","width":1472},{"text":"it'd be in your best interest to kinda go back and make sure you get those concepts","width":320},{"text":"I still need to secure the rooms, so I'm sorry about that","width":384},{"text":"I'm going to aim to no later than obviously in lecture tomorrow have those so I can tell you where to go","width":384},{"text":"I'll also, of course, post those on the course website and piazza, so they'll be in like three different places so you have no excuse not to know","width":384},{"text":"but that will happen today at some point, by tomorrow in lecture you should be able to know where you're going to be.","width":512},{"text":"MP memory .3 is due tomorrow at 11, so that's all of the parts now","width":448},{"text":"If you've done .1 and .2, .3 should be using your .1 and .2 to make your lives way easier than they would be otherwise.","width":640},{"text":"If you're just starting, good luck.","width":128},{"text":"MP list, also releases tonight, so some point today I'll have that ready and push that out, I assume most people, based on the autograding report that I got last night which said all of eleven people were done, I'm guessing nobody's going to start on that just yet.","width":1088},{"text":"That'll happen some point today, if you're one of those who's like super excited, then, it'll be out but probably studying for the exam is better use of your time at this point","width":768},{"text":"but that'll be out tonight","width":256},{"text":"Okay, that's everything for announcements, am I fogeting anything?","width":384},{"text":"alright, let's jump right in.","width":384}]
