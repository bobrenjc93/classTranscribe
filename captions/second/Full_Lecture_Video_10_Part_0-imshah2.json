[{"text":"okay, good afternoon. ","width":1024},{"text":"lets go ahead and get started, couple announcements","width":448},{"text":"first is that the exam is imminent, the exam will be on wednesday at 7pm and as of right now i have not received any requests for conflict, so there is not a conflict scheduled yet. If you have a conflict you probably should've emailed me like a week ago, but if you have a conflict, please email me like today. Like immediately after lecture today","width":1344},{"text":"so that I can figure out if we need to have a conflict or not, but as of right now there is not a conflict exam scheduled ","width":320},{"text":"As far as review for the exam goes, tomorrow's lab sections will be exam review. So if you go to your regular scheduled lab you will have your lab section leaders be doing exam review. ","width":1344},{"text":"Ideally, you should come to this review with questions, and mind for them to address because otherwise you're gonna be going through old practice exams which if fine, but may not be the best thing. It's better if you come to that with anything that you find confusing or want addressed as opposed to just going through practice exams","width":1280},{"text":"in particular, my warning will be to pay attention to move semantics, bes exams because they haven't used C++ 11 or 14 feature, so no questions on any of the practice exams are ever gonna mention C++ 11 or 14 features","width":1088},{"text":"And so if I say something is a C++ 11 or 14 feauture you should probably study that on your own because the practice exam won't cover it","width":832},{"text":"Empty memory, which you should all be done with now right? Is due tomorrow at 11. And hopefully everyone has received my email about nasal demons which is a very unpleasant condition to put yourself in.","width":1088},{"text":"make sure that you are not invoking undefined behavior, i've used that terminology several times before","width":512},{"text":"You've heard the term undefined behavior come out of my mouth, undefined behavior is very very bad and when you invoke it the compiler can do anything he wants with your code, including making demons fly out of your nose ","width":640},{"text":"not a pleasant situation to be in, so make sure that you're invoking undefined behavior","width":320},{"text":"can anyone give me an example of undefined behavior?","width":192},{"text":"what's one thing that i've said that is undefined behavior?","width":128},{"text":"there are several things","width":256},{"text":"most of them were like run time error causing things","width":320},{"text":"So what is one example of undefined behavior?","width":128},{"text":"I gave one example in the email. What is an example of undefined behavior?","width":512},{"text":"Raise your hand, what's an example of undefined behavior?","width":256},{"text":"okay what's an example of a run time error?","width":704},{"text":"give me an example of a run-time error","width":128},{"text":"segmentation fall, what can cause a segmentation fall?","width":320},{"text":"double free, double free is undefined behavior","width":384},{"text":"if you're freeing a pointer that you're already freeing, if you're deleting a pointer that you've already said delete on, that is undefined behavior","width":256},{"text":"The symptom is often a crash or segmentation fault, but it is undefined behavior so if you call delete on a pointer twice the compiler can do whatever the heck it wants with the code at that point because what it does is not defined by the standard and so the compiler vendor can do whatever the heck they want there. ","width":1088},{"text":"including but not limited to, crashing completely, keep corruption errors, nasal demons, etc","width":576},{"text":"Okay what's another example of undefined behavior? ","width":128},{"text":"That's a good one","width":128},{"text":"Think of other things that may cause seg faults or other things like that","width":320},{"text":"So what's another example of undefined behavior?","width":64},{"text":"Dereferencing a null pointer, yes, because it's a null pointer to memory that you don't own","width":576},{"text":"So in general, dereferencing a pointer that's not set to something that is valid memory for your program, either on the heap or in the stack is undefined behavior","width":576},{"text":"typically resulting in a segmentation fault, but it is technically undefined behavior","width":448},{"text":"what's another example of undefined behavior?","width":320},{"text":"yeah, using an non initialized value, int x and then printing x","width":192},{"text":"undefined behavior, it doesn't what is x, you have no idea, there is no defined thing that x should be if you just declare x and then print it out. So that is undefined behavior","width":640},{"text":"Seemingly innocuous, but it is undefined behavior which means that the compiler can do weird and crazy things","width":384},{"text":"There is a good post by somebody from microsoft that looked at a instance of undefined behavior causing what appeared to be time travel in his code","width":704},{"text":"So, don't invoke undefined behavior it's very behavior","width":256},{"text":"Other things that are undefined behavior are like signed integer overflow","width":128},{"text":"So if you get an integer that's at the maximum capacity for an integer on your platform and you increment it by 1, undefined behavior","width":576},{"text":"There's lots of things that cause undefined behavior and it's very very bad","width":576},{"text":"The one that is probably causing demons to fly out of a couple of your noses right now on the mp is using the wrong form of delete.","width":448},{"text":"What do I mean by using the wrong from of delete?","width":320},{"text":"What are the forms of delete?","width":192},{"text":"Delete brackets and delete","width":128},{"text":"One of them is used for deleting array in the heap and the other one is used for deleting pointers in the heap","width":384},{"text":"Mixing them up, is undefined behavior","width":192},{"text":"So if you call delete on something that was allocated with new brackets, undefined behavior","width":128},{"text":"Nasal demons","width":256},{"text":"If you call delete brackets on something that was allocated with just a normal new","width":256},{"text":"undefined behavior, nasal demons","width":128},{"text":"So doing that is not good, your program will start to do very very bizarro things that are very hard to debug","width":448},{"text":"If you're running under address sanitizer","width":256},{"text":"Address sanitizer will just kill your program as it happens","width":192},{"text":"But if you're not, then the observable behavior of a program probably doesn't make any sense because it's undefined behavior so you have no idea what it's actually going to do ","width":448},{"text":"So make sure that you're calling the right form of delete everywhere ","width":384}]
