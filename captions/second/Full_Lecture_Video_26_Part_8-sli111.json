What would the vertices be?","width":371},{"text":"Yeah, intersections, and the edges are like roads.","width":256},{"text":"Network, as in, like what kind of network? Yeah, so like a computer network. So like multiple computers connected together with routers and switches and stuff.","width":803},{"text":"So the vertices might be computers themselves, maybe you include routers and switched as part of the nodes of the network, and the edges just gonna be your cables.","width":448},{"text":"Or your wireless lans, if you have wireless set up.","width":254},{"text":"OK good.","width":68},{"text":"Hmm, why do I ask for clarification on network?","width":320},{"text":"Ok?","width":380},{"text":"What's a non technical network?","width":252},{"text":"Something that's not like a science network, but still a network?","width":399},{"text":"Sorry?","width":64},{"text":"Social networks.","width":192},{"text":"If you have a social network within this class, you know your lab mates and TAs, and the people taking other classes you are in.","width":516},{"text":"So you have a network but that network's gonna be the vertices are people, and the edges are friendships or hmm, relationships.","width":645},{"text":"There's an academic network, right?","width":164},{"text":"You have vertices that are researches and you have edges are you know the conferences, or advisors or the people they excited.","width":568},{"text":"You have networks all over the place.","width":162},{"text":"You have a network like Facebook, right?","width":89},{"text":"Facebook is just a giant network.","width":128},{"text":"So Facebook is a big old graph, that's all it is.","width":192},{"text":"So let's start thinking about some properties of graphs and some definitions of graph.","width":473},{"text":"Probably I won't go beyond this page today, but I want to try get through as much as I physically can.","width":371},{"text":"So graph can be weighted or unweighted.","width":313},{"text":"And this refers to there being a const associated with and edge or not.","width":586},{"text":"So if you think of your computer network.","width":140},{"text":"The computer network might be a weighted graph, where the weights are sort of the latency of the connection of the network.","width":419},{"text":"One of the things you might want to solve, as you are given some network topology like that.","width":389},{"text":"... is to find me the fasted path between a and b.","width":192},{"text":"You know taking account for all of the current latencies of the all the edges in this.","width":420},{"text":"Like if one cable is super ... don't use that one, use something else.","width":256},{"text":"So weighted sort of refers to...","width":640},{"text":"So it's weighted, it's like there is cost on it.

I can go either way.","width":154},{"text":"This edge just connects the two vertices.","width":206},{"text":"So directed versus undirected tells you whether your edges have forced direction that you must follow or not.","width":590},{"text":"Connected versus disconnected?","width":194}]
