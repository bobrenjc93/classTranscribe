[{"text":"Alright so lets try and do this with an array because lets try the naive solution first and see what its pitfalls are then adjust them with a different structure. So lets just do this with an array. So I made a disjoint sets object with 8 elements. ","width":1856},{"text":"Those are my set ids and they're all going to be initialized by themselves. ","width":704},{"text":"So find(i) would just return an array at i, that tells me what set it's in.","width":832},{"text":"Okay, fine so lets try and merge stuff together. So lets merge set 2 and 5 together. Merge this set and this set [on screen].","width":1024},{"text":"Remember that after this merging I want find of either of those to give me the same number, doesn't really matter which number it is and nobody else who's in that set gives me the same number.","width":1024},{"text":"So whats a reasonable choice here? I could pick 8 and change both to 8. It's probably easier to say one of them is going to be the canonical root so just pick one of those and set them both to that. For this one, lets say 2 is going to be the representative. So I'm going to set this to 2 now.","width":2368},{"text":"Fine. So now I want to merge 5 and 7. So I wanna merge the set that contains 5 with the set that contains 7. So what do I have to do there? I need to change 7 to 2, which happens to work here. So now 2,5 and 7 are all part of this set that is represented by 2.","width":2304},{"text":"What if I merge 0 and 1? So I can set 1 to 0. Merge 0 and 6. I can set 6 to 0. How did I know not to set 0 to 6? How do I check that? Yeah i don't know how to check size. In order to pick which thing is going to be the representative, I sort of have to know if anything has been used to merge into that representative before. And that might involve a scan of the array, actually even worse than that. So merge 1 and 2. What do I do now?","width":4416},{"text":"Don't is the answer. Right, so this is clearly bad. How am I going to do this, if I wanna merge 1 and 2, these 2 cells here. So doing that is not as easy as just picking one of those elements to be the new root, because theres a whole bunch of stuff in 2 and a whole bunch of stuff in 0. If I pick 2 to be the representative I have to go and set all the 0s I find in the array to be 2. If I pick 2 to be the representative, I have to set all the 0s as 2. Either way, I have to scan through the whole array looking for the element I've chosen to replace to set all of the things to point to the right set representative. ","width":3200},{"text":"We can do that [responding to question], it'll solve the problem of which one should be the root if theres only one thing in the other set. If I'm trying to merge 1 and 5 it is really bad. 1 is state merged, 5 is state merged. So now I need to go through and scan and set everything. Good thought but solves only half the problem.","width":4352},{"text":"This is sort of bad, like we know sort of everything in this is going to be kind of linear time in the worst case cause I need to go and scan and set stuff, it is not ideal. Lets try something different.","width":1664},{"text":"Well not completely, it also uses an array. What we're going to do is, we're going to have a tree structure but instead of this tree structure going from the root -> down, so children occur below it, it is going to go from leaves up, it is going to be called an uptree, so every node is going to refer to its parent but not its children. But every node in the tree can have multiple children referring up to it but a node doesn't know who they are. It seems a little weird but we'll see why it's useful.","width":3072},{"text":"Okay so we're going to make 7 sets so, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.","width":1024}]
