Please go to that so I can get them straightened out.","width":640},{"text":"There's a lot of material that we power through in the first week so if you have any questions about that go to that if you can.","width":576},{"text":"My other DYB is on Friday I'll have them normally on Friday.","width":1088},{"text":"I didn't get it scheduled in time last week so I'm having it now.","width":320},{"text":"Lab debug was due on Saturday, I just haven't ran the autograder yet so I'll do that and then youll get grades for that.","width":448},{"text":"It's not like there is an extended deadline, I just haven't gotten around to grading it.","width":384},{"text":"Mp memory will come out today at some point, I just need to actually finish the modifications to it that I want to.","width":448},{"text":"The start of it has a bunch of stuff in it that we are gonna cover in the first couple days in this week. So if you start it and think \"what the heck,\" don't worry about it, we're gonna cover it.","width":960},{"text":"As it has the stuff from tomorrow and wednesday","width":448},{"text":"There is enough information in the assignment specification that you should be able to just kinda read that and and believe it for now.","width":640},{"text":"You don't need all the specifications before you can actually dive into the assignment.","width":256},{"text":"The first part is super easy, but super super important.","width":320},{"text":"I'm still on the fence on whether I want to make this a partner mp or not.","width":512},{"text":"If i do, if you're working with your partner on the first part, make sure you both write it.","width":384},{"text":"Not just have your partner write part 1.","width":128},{"text":"If you do that you are gonna miss the material that I expect you to get practice with.","width":256},{"text":"And then you will be clueless for the rest of the semester on that particular thing.","width":192},{"text":"So I want you to at least do the first part independently, make sure you have written it yourself to get that experience","width":768},{"text":"The first thing we are gonna do is write a useful, but very small, very easy abstraction, that we are gonna use for pretty much the rest of the course. I want you to be very aware of how that works.","width":768},{"text":"So make sure you are doing that, if you have questions about how things work and why certain things are the way they are, ask on piazza or office hours, or me because that's super important.","width":960},{"text":"And then, homework 0 is in the process of being graded, I think but do not know, that it will be coming back in lab tomorrow, if not, then you will get it back on Thursday.","width":896},{"text":"We're shooting for Tuesday, but I don't know where we are with respect to that, but I know it is in the process of being graded.","width":512},{"text":"Ok so quick couple of prelecture stuff. We will go over the very last prelecture question.","width":1024},{"text":"To answer a lot of them, the answer should've said it makes an extra copy, it does of course actually try and do a copy, that's the point of the assignment.","width":768},{"text":"It is doing a copy, I meant to say is it doing more copying than the one that is in the video, and the answer is it is not.","width":640},{"text":"I apologize for the slightly confusing wording in that question.","width":320},{"text":"If you read the answer, then it makes sense but I should've said that in the question so I meant, it makes an extra copy (more then 1). Sorry for the wording.","width":1728},{"text":"So there is a lot going on so we will touch on that.","width":320},{"text":"We are going to write an assignment operator, so I will show you a wrong way to do it then we can talk about what's wrong with it.","width":448},{"text":"What does return *this mean?","width":192},{"text":"Remember that *this only means something if you are inside of a member function of a class.","width":512},{"text":"Otherwise this has no meaning, because what is this?","width":128},{"text":"This is always going to be a pointer to the current instance of an object if you are inside of that object.","width":448},{"text":"If you are in a member function of an object this is going to be initialized to point at the object on which that method is being called.","width":448},{"text":"So return *this means return the current object.","width":256},{"text":"So in the assignment operator we return the current object when we are done assigning into it and the reason for that is you can chain assignments.","width":448},{"text":"I don't recommend it but you can.","width":320},{"text":"That equal operator needs to return something for that last assignment to be valid.","width":384},{"text":"a = b = c should assign b into c and then return the b that's been assigned and then assign that into a.","width":448},{"text":"So you need to return something out of it.","width":128},{"text":"Again, we'll hit on that in the actual lecture so don't worry about that to much.","width":192},{"text":"Was it a typo to omit the parameter name in gallery.h? ","width":448},{"text":"So I had functions in gallery.h that I didn't actually name the parameter, I just said a type, something like const gallery& and didn't give a name.","width":704},{"text":"That's fine as long as it is in the header","width":64},{"text":"If it is in the definition I need to actually have the variables that I'm referring to.","width":384},{"text":"If I don't give it a name It will still compile but  I can't refer to my argument anymore.","width":320},{"text":"In the header file it is fine to omit the name of the parameter.","width":320},{"text":"Because you are not using it there.","width":64},{"text":"It's not a typo it is ok.","width":128},{"text":"Typically I won't do that but I'll do that when I'm really crammed for space.","width":320},{"text":"So when I really need that extra 3 pixels, I'm going to try and omit parameter names. It's not actually a bug.","width":768}]
