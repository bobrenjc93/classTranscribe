It was really expensive. And I liked it because I looked at the advertisements and I looked at like some people have it and it looks so cool and like emm the Macbook Air is so well-designed and everything is so beautiful and I've always wanted to have an Apple Macbook and then I could finally afford it and the first computer I bought is Apple. ","width":1920.4},{"text":"RUBY: Well, totally different from her experiences, I've tried the Macbook on my friend's computer and I think at that time I found it very difficult to use because I'm not used to the system. And because I am really bad at adapting to new technology devices. ","width":1088.4},{"text":"RUBY: So before buying I was just being attracted to the style and the design of the appearances. But emm and before using Mac I was using the Microsoft's system so I was really panicked when adapting to it. But I found that I only get two weeks to get used to the system so I found Apple is very good. So I think if I want to change the notebook in the future I would just consider Apple and I will no longer like go back to Microsoft.","width":2048.4},{"text":"BEI: Yeah I agree. Because first you use the system of Apple you may find it difficult to command it, but I think Apple has an ability to change your user behavior and make you get used to the system it designed for you. ","width":1024.4},{"text":"MIKI: And I want to mention that I bought another Apple Macbook last year and then I got it back home and I taught my mum how to use it and then my mum just get used to it very fast. But before that when I taught my mum how to use the Microsoft and other computers and my mum thought it was really harder to use. So I think the Apple's system is much more convenient for her.","width":2048.4},{"text":"MODERATOR: Okay, sure, so these are views. What about you two? I see you both have different colors of Apples. ","width":384.4},{"text":"Tiffany: I actually bought my mac so long ago and originally I want to buy it because its battery is good and it's so cool and I can take it with me all day, so it's more convenient than a PC which only lasts for 4 hours. So that's the reason I bought it.","width":1856.4},{"text":"MODERATOR: Okay, so in addition to it kind of looking cool, the functionality is really good.","width":384.4},{"text":"Tiffany: Yes, and (in terms of the skin) I bought is because I think other people all have macs so it's difficult to tell which is mine and which is yours so I want to make it into this skin.","width":960.4},{"text":"MODERATOR: Okay, great.","width":192.4},{"text":"CONNY: I used to use Thinkpad but it always shut down and it's very annoying and I am a technology idiot so I don't know how to tackle with that. One day I went shopping and I see there is a student discount of the Mac, around 900RMB so I think it's a very good deal so I just but it.","width":1344.4},{"text":"AKUA: But I was interested in ehh, because when I got the Macbook, because I was so used to Microsoft so maybe let me just still install Microsoft (in the mac) so I can have like everything of my Macbook. So that I get to the page and looking for the Macbook version.","width":1408.4},{"text":"MODERATOR: So I see a lot of you nodding your heads so in terms of the hardware, you know, you are all from what I heard, happy with your Macintoshs but in terms of the operating system, the software, what you do on it, how many of your have a Microsoft's kind of thing?","width":1024.4}]
