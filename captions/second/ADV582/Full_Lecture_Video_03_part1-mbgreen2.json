[{"text":"I used to ask but now with this new (can't understant) I was just too lazy to get used to it, i learned to use the keynote and the pages and the apple apps and I found they are not as convenient as the microsofts but you can still handle it if you if you dont do things that are too fancy ","width":1792},{"text":"Microsoft office included too many functions so sometimes the functions when i use it otherwise you have another kind of things you have to deal with when you use it, Â  but nowadays I only use microsoft office if I need to share the documents with people not using a Mac , honestly most of the time I use pages and keynote because they have more functions that more useful for doing a good powerpoint presentation or designs","width":971},{"text":"I think that technology company offers more choices for people to choose what like and design whenther I want to use powerpoint or keynote or word or pages it is kind of a choice","width":1216},{"text":"Okay and you like to have different kinds of choices?","width":128},{"text":"And too many people are using microsoft and when they send to file and sometimes when we open with pages something will be different so you have to also install microsoft so you can see the file","width":960},{"text":"Okay so if you are collaborating with other people and they do not have the same system you find Microsoft is still kind of necessary?","width":640},{"text":"Yeah, I think whenever we send out something we don't actually use the pages, we always convert it to PDF or download","width":2415},{"text":"You can save it (can't understand)","width":384},{"text":"I think the, those....My friends said they are difficult to use, now all of them are more convinced to go buy apple, this is so much harder, you have to go back to 2007, but soon then they feel like they are using stuff that is behind the times so they might as well switch to apple when the laptop is no longer functioning","width":2560},{"text":"I think Windows 8 is more suitable for touch screen nothing functions more for touch screen","width":384},{"text":"Yeah it is so hard to use anytime I use my friends laptop and its Windows 8 and i'm watching a movie and the somehow the page changes to where all the functions are on and I'm like please come do somehting and I dont even try because I can't","width":832},{"text":"I find that Windows is more compatible to other systems because there are many applications that we can use with Windows system but we can use with Apple system so many of my friends not use Apple because it is too inconvenient for them","width":1664},{"text":"So compatibility?
