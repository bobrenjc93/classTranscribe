[{"text":"lets get started......the first thing i wanna sort of touch on before i jumping to the lecture today","width":1408},{"text":"is a little bit of minor clarification on sort of the interesting question that we are getting yesterday about what the actual cases could be ","width":576},{"text":"for the balance factor of egd left child in a rebalanced left","width":448},{"text":"similarly for rebalanced right","width":128},{"text":"there was a confusion about that i was saying oh yeah i can actually have a balance factor of 0 on the left child","width":512},{"text":"and i was partially right","width":128},{"text":"but i would say no wait you could have a balance factor of 0","width":128},{"text":"in the left child and then he was also partially right","width":256},{"text":"the answer is if you doing only insertion so like the lab you cant ever end up with a balance factor of 0","width":576},{"text":"for the left child in a rebalanced left ","width":192},{"text":"or a right child in a rebalanced right ","width":128},{"text":"and the reason for that is when you doing a rebalance at node ","width":256},{"text":"you are doing that because you increase the height of some subtree","width":256},{"text":"by one ","width":128},{"text":"thats why there is an inbalance ","width":192},{"text":"its was balanced before i inserted a node now there is inbalance that means necessarily that the height of something changed ","width":512},{"text":"if my left subtree was perfectly balanced it has a balance factor of 0 i could not create that the left hand side by adding a node to increase the height by one ","width":768},{"text":"cause i increased the height by one that necessarily win on some side of the tree ","width":384},{"text":"so that should have balance factor of at least one ","width":128},{"text":"the absolute value of balance factor of at least one ","width":192},{"text":"i cant insert and then have a child have balance factor of 0","width":320},{"text":"so the case we are looking at u know the left child of the balance factor of 0 can not happen if you are just doing insertion ","width":512},{"text":"however, if you doing removals it now can and here is an example","width":448},{"text":"so if we look at this tree every i did this was all flat with xxxx","width":320},{"text":"cause you should be able to do that within 5 mins ","width":256},{"text":"and i build the following tree and here is the tree, its an avl tree. if we remove 7, so we are trying to get rid of this guy","width":640},{"text":"we remove 7 we get this picture, still avl tree","width":512},{"text":"no issues there, no inbalance ","width":128},{"text":"but now we see on the left side we got the case on the left sort of child could be balance factor of 0","width":512},{"text":"specifically if i now remove the 30, if i remove this guy","width":384},{"text":"as i go out of the tree there is an inbalance","width":256},{"text":"at 20...its heavy on the left so i need to do a right rotation so im gonna be calling rebalance left here","width":576},{"text":"and now if i look at the balance factor of the nodes to its left and is indeed 0","width":320},{"text":"so this can happen but only when you are doing removal, it wont happen when you doing insertions","width":512},{"text":"......","width":256},{"text":"in this case which i showed on the slide during lecture you just do a single rotation you do not need to do a double rotation","width":448},{"text":"so the.....short of it, is the code rewrote in the lecture is correct even for the case of removal","width":576},{"text":"you do need to do the rotation on the case when your left child in this case is has balance vector of 0","width":384},{"text":"and the rotation you need to do is the single right rotate, its not a double rotation","width":256},{"text":"so a way of keeping that straight of is last standard is equal to ...think if the balance factor disagrees, its a double rotation ","width":704},{"text":"otherwise its a single rotation ","width":128},{"text":"always ","width":64},{"text":"if you in rebalance left you know there is an inbalance you must redoing some kind of rotation","width":256},{"text":"something will happen inside rebalance if you are there","width":192},{"text":"rebalance left","width":192},{"text":"if aint just the rebalance function","width":64},{"text":"figures out if there is an inbalance it calls one of those so if there's no inbalance you will not have rebalance left or rebalance right called ","width":512},{"text":"they are only called if there is an inbalance so if you are inside a rebalance left or you are inside a rebalance right ","width":384},{"text":"you know that you have to be doing ","width":64},{"text":"some kind of rotation ","width":64},{"text":"so the answer is if the balance factor sign disagrees with the inbalance node, do a double rotation","width":448},{"text":"otherwise, do a single rotation ","width":128},{"text":"even in the case when its 0, you still need to do a single rotation because here if i remove tat 40","width":448},{"text":"its clear that i need to do somekind of rotation about the 20","width":256},{"text":"otherwise its inbalanced ","width":128},{"text":"and if i just do a single rotation","width":128},{"text":"i get a picture that looks like this ","width":192},{"text":"which is now balanced ","width":128},{"text":"the code rewrotten lecture is fine but its sort of a settle point that i do wat you to be aware of ","width":704},{"text":"so when you are doing insertion ","width":128},{"text":"you cant actually end up with a balance factor of the elft child that is being 0 because you had to increase ","width":384},{"text":"the height or when you doing removal that is indeed possible to create that case ","width":256},{"text":"and so we need to do a single rotation when the balance factor of the heavy child is 0","width":384},{"text":"and tis just the single one ","width":128},{"text":"this is on piazza if you just go look at that ","width":192},{"text":"i just wanna to make sure that is clear ","width":192},{"text":"at least people we are watching the video for everybody who came in late they can go back and see my explaination","width":704},{"text":"along those lines lab avl is gonna be due tomorrow at 11, you should be able to do that fairly easily ","width":640},{"text":"we've talked about pretty much all over the code ","width":64},{"text":"except for the rotation function thenselves and all you really need to write that is rotate left and rotate right ","width":448},{"text":"cause rotate right-left and left-right are basically just call of the two rotations ","width":256},{"text":"so the hard part is only the rotate left and rotate right ","width":192},{"text":"which are like 5 lines function maybe","width":128},{"text":"and once you've done that, you can now add removal to your avl tree","width":576},{"text":"its basically the same for removal the binary search tree ","width":384},{"text":"except for you need to do the rebalancing ","width":192},{"text":"so you should try that you should try writting some code at removal to avl trees ","width":512},{"text":"because you should be able to do that at this point and you should be able to see what the only modifications you need to have compared to binary search trees ","width":384},{"text":"and we did write all the code for removal for binary search trees ","width":256},{"text":"you can just basically pour that code to your avl tree cause its binary search tree","width":256},{"text":"and add that staff you need to fix the balance factor ","width":192},{"text":"which you basically already written ","width":128},{"text":"and p staff so the extra credit is friday","width":320},{"text":"full deadline is friday","width":128},{"text":"the next mp will be out on Monday as well","width":192},{"text":"we've got an exam on that wednesday next week, content for that would be basically dictionaries ","width":448},{"text":"so bst, avl trees ","width":128},{"text":"and the data structure we will begin talking about today","width":192},{"text":"im still grading exam 2, that doesnt go back tomorrow thats my falut ","width":384},{"text":"and also there is going to be a mp_qtree","width":448},{"text":"solution party on tuesday","width":128},{"text":"next week","width":64},{"text":"at 715 tentetively ","width":256},{"text":"on 1404 sc","width":64},{"text":"please check piazza for anymore updates ","width":192},{"text":"im not really involved in that at all so","width":320},{"text":"thank them along for willing to do that","width":64}]
