It will be two hours long, so it won't be three hours.","width":384},{"text":"-----------------","width":24},{"text":"So you should expect something that's sort of similar in length to the regular midterms with the exception that this will be comprehensive, so it will cover stuff kind of all over the place.","width":704},{"text":"----------------","width":38},{"text":"There will be sort of more of an emphasis on the stuff that we haven't had a midterm on yet.","width":306},{"text":"So you should make sure that you know your graphs.","width":122},{"text":"But there will be coverage from pretty much every part in the semester, so you'll need to brush up on everything if you don't remember some of the stuff from the very beginning.","width":576},{"text":"-----------------","width":35},{"text":"Mp graph is due Wednesday at the regular due date time, so you should be done with that before reading day so that you can have reading day to actually study for the final.","width":576},{"text":"----------------","width":64},{"text":"---------------------","width":6},{"text":"I might happen to be in this room on Thursday at the same time that class is usually, and I might happen to have a blank exam 3 on me so I might happen to accidentally do a postmortem on reading day if you want to attend.","width":947},{"text":"------------------","width":42},{"text":"But that's just, I might happen to be here.","width":192},{"text":"----------------","width":64},{"text":"It's not an official review session.","width":128},{"text":"------------------","width":64},{"text":"So, there's also one last little bit of extra credit that you can get and that will be through this class transcribe system. So we're going to try using the same system that the CS 241 Systems Programming class used for lecture transcription, so the end result of this would be a search engine where you can type in any word or any phrase or any topic and it will give you exactly which lecture in which that word occurred and a time stamp","width":2079},{"text":"and you can click that time stamp and lecture video and jump immediately to the point where I said those words.","width":448},{"text":"--------------------","width":29},{"text":"So if you do the transcription work, so everyone will be assigned, if you haven't already, will be assigned some number of transcription tasks, so this may be actually doing transcription, so like transcribing what I said, writing down the words that I said","width":1185},{"text":"you might be fixing the timing, so you might be, you know, making sure that the subtitles match up with exactly where I'm saying the sentence.","width":512},{"text":"---------------------","width":128},{"text":"But in any case, everyone will be assigned a certain number of tasks, and if you complete at least the tasks you were assigned at the start, you can do more if you want, but if you do at least the ones that you were assigned, you'll get 1% extra credit.","width":704},{"text":"-----------------------","width":128},{"text":"And again, when I say extra credit, I do mean that extra credit is extra. Like I do grade cut-offs before looking at the EC.","width":512},{"text":"So EC is purely just an added boost after I've decided what the cut-offs will be. ","width":313},{"text":"So it's not as though you have to do the EC in order to get on the same playing field as everybody else. No. I do the grades first and then just add in the EC after that.","width":704},{"text":"-----------------------","width":106},{"text":"No.","width":64},{"text":"So, the EC caps at 1 and it's if you've done the ones that are there. Obviously if you want this system to actually work for studying, everyone will have to do a little more than what they were assigned.","width":896},{"text":"Because otherwise, you know, I anticipate not everyone doing it, and so, if there's only like x of you doing it, you're probably going to have to do a little more than just the ones you were assigned if you want this to work.","width":780},{"text":"And it's in your own best interest because transcribing will make sure that you're reviewing whatever part that you're transcribing, and then also, it gives you this really nice search thing so you can find exactly the material that you're looking for. So like, I don't really remember how that part worked.","width":945},{"text":"I don't remember when we talked about how swap worked and whether it was, was it by r-value reference or reference or how did it work with move semantics. I don't remember that at all, so I can search for swap and find all of the places where I said swap.","width":896},{"text":"And then one of those is going to be the one you care about.","width":192},{"text":"So this is sort of in your own best interest to do, but I'm not forcing you, it's not required, but if you want a nice study tool, this worked really, really well for 241.","width":896},{"text":"---------------------------------","width":320},{"text":"If you do the ones that are sent to you by e-mail, then you're good.","width":192},{"text":"----------------","width":42},{"text":"And the system will keep track of that so I don't have to worry about that.","width":256},{"text":"-","width":192},{"text":"So, let's jump in then.","width":128}]
