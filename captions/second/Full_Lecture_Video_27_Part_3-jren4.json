[{"text":"okay what else? ok so read, write, execute","width":765},{"text":"in other words what kind of access you can do","width":230},{"text":" can you read it write it execute it","width":84},{"text":" eat it smell it sniff it? yeah","width":220},{"text":" who owns it","width":27},{"text":" ok","width":545},{"text":" what else? yes","width":237},{"text":" ok who modified it last","width":764},{"text":" what else? last opened? ok","width":565},{"text":" when last opened","width":118},{"text":" might be useful say for backing up things","width":290},{"text":" or optimizing where things are on the disk","width":218},{"text":" what else? hm? path ok","width":1063},{"text":"ok","width":62},{"text":" yes","width":94},{"text":" hahah yes name","width":265},{"text":" yeah would you like file #7 or file #8","width":144},{"text":" i don't know which one is which","width":147},{"text":" ok anything else","width":62},{"text":" yes","width":184},{"text":" ok whether its kind of binary or text","width":671},{"text":" alright anything else","width":190},{"text":" ok version","width":505},{"text":" alright i'll add one more which is um where","width":275},{"text":" how to get the actual contents","width":182},{"text":" we probably want the contents of the time","width":98},{"text":" we didn't actually talk about it","width":114},{"text":" we talked about all this great meta information","width":91},{"text":" we didn't talk about the fact that yeah all that has some contents as well","width":214},{"text":" so we probably need to store exactly how to go do the disk","width":200},{"text":" which disk blocks being used to actually hold the contents of the file","width":413},{"text":" it'd be a pretty silly file system if we couldn't actually store any content with it","width":565},{"text":"right so actually what we've described here is this basic idea of an information node or an inode that we'll find again and again in various kinds of file systems","width":985},{"text":" so we've described alot of meta information uhh for real inodes, let me mention some things that don't exist","width":493},{"text":" there isn't a path","width":91},{"text":" we just have um fact we don't have name either","width":745},{"text":" uhh the other thing we don't have is um lets see","width":231},{"text":" who modified it","width":319},{"text":" the other thing we don't have is file type","width":500},{"text":"but we do have things like the left when was it last modified","width":223},{"text":" there's an owner","width":175},{"text":" and we can find all these things inside a basic inode","width":497},{"text":" so i\"m going to today talk about one of the simplest permission models and it's this","width":433},{"text":" each file has an owner or user, a group, and then we can then just talk about the general public","width":644},{"text":" everybody else","width":77},{"text":" whether they're allowed to touch this file or use this file in some way","width":348},{"text":"and for each of these three different kinds of people that might want to use our file","width":442},{"text":" there are just three permissions","width":206},{"text":" read write execute","width":247},{"text":" read write execute","width":197},{"text":"read write execute","width":67},{"text":"unfortunately there is no edible bit","width":287},{"text":"perhaps for next years april fools you'd like to write your own filesystem that is edible","width":327},{"text":" so we can basically say if you're the owner of the file","width":255},{"text":" if you're the user owns the file","width":96},{"text":" you can read it you can write it you can execute it","width":213},{"text":" if you happen to be inside this if the user trying to access this file is the member of the group that owns this file then again we can specify some permissions everybody else gets these permissions","width":1431},{"text":" so here is a surprising potential gotcha","width":198},{"text":" in C guess what happens if you start your number literals","width":245},{"text":" your integer literals with the number 0","width":257},{"text":" you're speaking octal","width":233},{"text":" so if you were to write int a = 0123 congratulations you just managed to confuse a java programmer","width":968},{"text":" this is not 123","width":252},{"text":" each one of these digits represents three bits","width":835},{"text":"so this is exactly what we need if we want to talk about our user group and other permissions","width":436},{"text":" because we can encode three bits into this number and easily read it off as well","width":358},{"text":" so this is 001","width":119},{"text":" this is 010","width":108},{"text":" and this one is 011","width":354},{"text":" so I can easily read off what is going to be the user group and everyone else in terms of their permissions","width":413},{"text":" we'll talk more about that on monday","width":190},{"text":" no wednesday my apologies","width":362},{"text":"ok","width":445},{"text":" right i'll mention though","width":80},{"text":" some useful calls here","width":356},{"text":" we're going to run into chmod to change the uh permission bits on a file","width":427},{"text":" and there is a call you can make inside c and theres a call you can make inside the shell","width":427},{"text":"there's chown","width":185},{"text":" if you want to change the owner","width":300},{"text":" you already know mkdir for making a directory","width":332},{"text":" perhaps you didn't know mkdir -p which is useful which makes all of the parent subdirectories if they don't exist","width":438},{"text":" so for example I can say a/b/c and rather that complaining that a and b don't exist","width":574},{"text":" it will make a and b if they don't exist","width":356},{"text":" here's some other little tricks that you don't know","width":265},{"text":" if you just write cd to change directory it goes back to your home directory","width":529},{"text":" this is in the shell","width":169},{"text":" also in the shell","width":204},{"text":"  tilde i uh once had a book that referred to this symbol as a corgi as in a small little dog excrement","width":938}]
