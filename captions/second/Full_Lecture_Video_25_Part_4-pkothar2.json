[{"text":"Give me some of your favorite foods? Pizza, whats another? Chipotle. Putting a TM so we don't get sued. What else? Cereal. One more? Coco-cola.","width":2176},{"text":"So we've got some favorite foods, obviously not an exhaustive list. Maybe it's a potentially infinite set. What I want to do is be able to tell if you give me some student as 1 and some student as 2, I want to be able to efficiently tell if they have the same favorite food.","width":1920},{"text":"So in other words, in terms of code what I want to say is that find(s1) == find(s2) implies that s1 and s2 have the same favorite food. ie. s1 and s2 exist in the partition of the room for whoevers favorite food is for example pizza.","width":1152},{"text":"So if I found everybody who agreed I would find a partition of the room where everybody had the same favorite food. The sets will be decided by the favorite foods of the students. So I'm gonna have a bunch of these sets. Making an assumption where everyone has one favorite food. Can only belong to one set.","width":1664},{"text":"And then, in order to build these sets up I'm going to start off by having some set representative being the representative for the class of people whose favorite food is pizza. The people who volunteered. Those would be the set representatives. What I'll do to build those sets up is look at another student and say \"is your favorite food pizza?\" if so I'll add you to the set of all students who like pizza. Then I'll talk to other guys and add them too.","width":1920},{"text":"So the operations I've got are basically find and merge. Find, given a student, will tell you what set a student belongs to. And merge of two different students (set reps) will merge the set of students whose favorite foods are in agreement. I can merge together different sets of students. Everyone starts off as their own sets and I can merge them together by partition.","width":1728},{"text":"Do you have any idea what this models? So I can see pretty easily if a student is in a set that is a favorite food. But if I see a new student by default they're in their own set. So I may have to iterate over the sets. So this might not be quite what this gets you easily. Cause all I can do is given a student, determine what set they belong to. And also merge two sets.","width":3456},{"text":"Okay so right, it's a way of categorizing everything. So I can very easily see if two things belong to the same set. I can very easily merge two sets together. ","width":1536},{"text":"What mathematical concept does this represent? Hint look at the thing right below it. What is this? It's an equivalence relation. I'm saying that student 1 and student 2 are equivalent if they belong to the same set.","width":1472},{"text":"I'm representing everything no longer by the students themselves but by the sets they belong to. I can ask a student what set he belongs to and he'll say the set of students who like his favorite food. So I know, for any student I can figure out what set they belong to and I can ask the set representative what the favorite food was.","width":1472},{"text":"Okay, so this is an equivalence relation. I can see very quickly if two things are related, or if they are not. If the relation is everyone who shares same favorite food, and I ask someone who's favorite food is pizza and someone who's favorite is cereal, they will not be equivalent because they belong to two different sets.","width":1920},{"text":"Which is 173 material. Let's review that. Binary relation on a set S, is said to be an equivalence relationship if and only if there is blank, blank blank. 3 properties it must have. ","width":1856},{"text":"There's three vocab words. Okay. Right. Reflexive, symmetric, transitive. ","width":2176},{"text":"So what do those mean? If I have a relation thats reflexive, what does that tell me? So in this equivalence relation if it's reflexive, I know that for any, for all s in S, s relates to s. However I've defined R, if it's reflexive I know that you always relate to yourself. So we think of the example we had before where the relation was people who share same favorite food. I share my own favorite food with myself. So that is reflexive.","width":4352}]
