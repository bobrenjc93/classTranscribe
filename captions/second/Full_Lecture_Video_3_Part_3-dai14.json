[{"text":"ok","width":512},{"text":"alright","width":128},{"text":"so","width":64},{"text":"lets get back together now","width":128},{"text":"so what is porblem 1 do","width":128},{"text":"repeat","width":256},{"text":"yes exact","width":320},{"text":"guys can you be quiet so i can hear","width":320},{"text":"i ive guessed that print 4,2","width":1472},{"text":"the middle of there","width":448},{"text":"address of 4.2","width":192},{"text":"any other guesses?","width":192},{"text":"undefined behavior> what'd you say that?","width":64},{"text":"so lets.... so i have 3 different answers, so lets draw memory diagram so we can walk through this","width":1088},{"text":"so we can be very clear about what exactly is going on here","width":256},{"text":"i have a syntax frame","width":128},{"text":"i declare auto frad equals to double 4.2","width":320},{"text":"what is the type of fred?","width":192},{"text":"pointer to what?","width":128},{"text":"a double","width":64},{"text":"where is fred exist?","width":192},{"text":"on the stack\\","width":192},{"text":"where is the thing that fred point at exist?","width":192},{"text":"on the heap...ok, that's important distinction","width":192},{"text":"fred is actually here","width":128},{"text":"fred is a pointer","width":192},{"text":"has been initialized point at a double in the heap","width":256},{"text":"auto George equals to fred ","width":384},{"text":"whats the type of george","width":128},{"text":"a pointer to a....double ","width":320},{"text":"where does george exist?","width":64},{"text":"on thestack","width":128},{"text":"and its initialized to be ","width":448},{"text":"what?","width":128},{"text":"fred, so what does that mean","width":192},{"text":"it points at the 4.2 in th heap","width":192},{"text":"so assigning in to a pointer just give it the location just put the memory location ","width":384},{"text":"so i have the same memory location stored in red","width":192},{"text":"i have the same memory location stored in george","width":64},{"text":"if fred is foxxxxe42","width":384},{"text":"george is what i just said ","width":128},{"text":"it just copies that integer value that is a pointer over","width":192},{"text":"its not gonna make new memory, its not going to put a 4.2 in the stack or georges ","width":512},{"text":"its gonna make george point at the same thing","width":128},{"text":"the pointer value is just a memory location","width":256},{"text":"so the picture would look like ......ok.....delete fred, what is that do?","width":448},{"text":"frees the memory associated with the thing that fred points at, right?","width":512},{"text":"so that means that all of the pointer and then delete the memory relinquish the memory","width":384},{"text":"that is at the end of that pointer back to the system so that can be used for other purposes","width":256},{"text":"so fred ok","width":128},{"text":"go to the end of that pointer ","width":64},{"text":"free that memory","width":128},{"text":"to be released back to the system","width":64},{"text":"use for something else","width":192},{"text":"and then i do some other things","width":64},{"text":"i try to print out *geoge","width":256},{"text":"what happens ","width":576},{"text":"could be a seg fault ","width":64},{"text":"it might print 4.2","width":64},{"text":"it might u know","width":192},{"text":"eat your cat","width":64},{"text":"this is undefined behavior","width":64},{"text":"so the undefined behavior answer is the right one ","width":192},{"text":"the reason for that is that you got a pointer to memory that you given back to the system","width":256},{"text":"the system can do whatever it wants now","width":192},{"text":"if that happens to not use that yet","width":128},{"text":"might happen to still be inside the heap segment for the program cause the operating system ","width":320},{"text":"maybe as given now back into the system","width":64},{"text":"to decide when it does that","width":128},{"text":"but....its certainly undefined behavior ","width":320},{"text":"its certainly not what you want","width":64},{"text":"so this is bad","width":128},{"text":"yeah","width":576},{"text":"so...so... yeah","width":320},{"text":"printing out...kinda of ","width":64},{"text":"printing out a un initialized value ","width":128},{"text":"is an undefined behavior","width":128},{"text":"but undefined behavior is larger than just printing out initialized value","width":192},{"text":"undefined behavior is staff that the c++ standard doesnt say","width":384},{"text":"what would happen when you do that","width":64},{"text":"it doesnt say what will happen, print out an unintialized variable","width":384},{"text":"because if it did","width":64},{"text":"then the system would have to ","width":64},{"text":"setting a value every time","width":64},{"text":"you declare something which is insufficient","width":192},{"text":"this is undefined behavior because it cant grantee what gonna do","width":192},{"text":"because the semantics dont make sense like what should it do ","width":320},{"text":"maybe it should crash, maybe it shouldn't ","width":64},{"text":"but if you say it has to crash","width":128},{"text":"it has be able to tag memories not there anymore","width":256},{"text":"that why im defining behavior exists","width":256},{"text":"language efficient","width":320},{"text":"anything that i say is undefined behavior","width":448},{"text":"is in the class variable of run time errors ","width":192},{"text":"cause undefined behavior isnt gonna be caught a compile time ","width":192},{"text":"you gonna observe it when you run the program and see something really busy ","width":384},{"text":"and you dont know why","width":64}]
