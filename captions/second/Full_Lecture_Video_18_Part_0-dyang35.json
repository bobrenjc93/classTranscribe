Hopefully everyone knows what their last name is by now and so everybody can go to the correct room","width":384},{"text":"If you need special accommodations for your exam, I need to know immediately","width":448},{"text":"so that I can accommodate them","width":192},{"text":"MP Qtree point 1 is due Friday at eleven","width":192},{"text":"so this is the extra credit part, this is only a two part MP, so this is all of the extra credit on one go","width":320},{"text":"MP Qtree point 2 is the whole MP, due Monday","width":320},{"text":"In lab today we'll be reviewing, so make sure you go to your lab sections,","width":192},{"text":"prepared with your questions to ask your lab TAs about","width":192},{"text":"content that we've covered for this midterm","width":192},{"text":"There will also be an MP list solution party, this has been on the Piazza since last week","width":256},{"text":"but I'm announcing it again","width":64},{"text":"Tonight at 7:15 in 1404 Siebel Center","width":320},{"text":"So, if you feel like your list knowledge was insufficient and needs a boost","width":384},{"text":"please consider attending that","width":128},{"text":"because we'll go over, a master will go over the mp_list","width":384},{"text":"MP entirely from scratch in front of you in about an hour","width":384},{"text":"So, do attend that if you didn't","width":128},{"text":"if you feel you didn't get enough out of mp_list","width":320},{"text":"Ok","width":128},{"text":"Jumping right in I lied I really wanna cover this algorithm","width":256},{"text":"so the first two questions here are gonna be stuff that could appear on the midterm 'cos they are about heaps","width":320},{"text":"but I really wanted to ","width":256},{"text":"cover this algorithm in enough detail so that you sort of know what's going on","width":384},{"text":"So, we","width":256},{"text":"are designing an algorithm that can sort an array in place","width":64},{"text":"by using heap algorithms that we've talked about","width":128},{"text":"and the question is how does it compare to sorting algorithms that you already know","width":256},{"text":"So, what do I mean when I'm talking about an algorithm","width":192},{"text":"that's doing something to an array in-place?","width":128},{"text":"What does that mean?","width":256},{"text":"When I say \"in-place\", what I'm I talking about?","width":128},{"text":"yeah","width":192},{"text":"Right, I\"m using the array that I was given","width":192},{"text":"So this means that I'm not gonna copy the data into another new array","width":320},{"text":"and then do something to my copy","width":128},{"text":"In-place means, here's the data, it's in this array already","width":256},{"text":"Use that array to do your algorithm, okay.","width":256},{"text":"Furthermore, this means that I shouldn't be allocating any new memory","width":256},{"text":"to do this, okay","width":128},{"text":"So, if I talk about an in-place sorting algorithm","width":256},{"text":"on arrays, typically as written in 125 or your other programming prereq classes","width":448},{"text":"merge sort would not be an in-place algorithm","width":192},{"text":"because you're making a new array to merge the data into","width":256},{"text":"and then you are returning that out, right","width":64},{"text":"So typically people when they're writing merge sort, they are not writing in-place merge sort","width":256},{"text":"However, you have all written an in-place merge sort at this point","width":384},{"text":"we did it in mp_list","width":128},{"text":"If you think about what happened in mp_list, you didn't allocate any new nodes in the operation","width":256},{"text":"So you were sorting the list in-place","width":192},{"text":"So \"in-place\" is talking about, it is saying that you are not allocating any new memory","width":384},{"text":"and you're using the memory that was already there, to do the algorithm, okay","width":320},{"text":"So that's what I mean by 'in-place'","width":128},{"text":"I'm talking about we're gonna sort this array in-place","width":192},{"text":"I'm saying we will allocate no additional space, at all","width":256},{"text":"we're gonna use the exact array that we were given","width":128},{"text":"And we're gonna modify that array, so that it is sorted","width":256},{"text":"So probably we're gonna do a crap tons of swaps","width":256},{"text":"'cos we can't, we don't have any room to put anything substantial, so","width":320},{"text":"so we sort of have to use the array itself so we're probably gonna swap stuff around a lot","width":320},{"text":"Okay","width":64},{"text":"So I give you some arbitrary array","width":192},{"text":"and I say sort it in-place using heap algorithms","width":192},{"text":"What's kind of the first thing you have to do before you can start using heap algorithms on it?","width":256}]
