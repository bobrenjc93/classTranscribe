Sort of waiting for, them to know exactly how many rooms they need for that. So, those will be announced probably next week. ","width":1168.3999999761581},{"text":"Practice problems will go up today. I'm just drowning under all the things I have to get done, so I haven't had a chance to put them up yet.","width":448.39999997615814},{"text":"Again, the same story as last time will apply. So, there will be things on those exams that we have not covered yet. Don't panic. Only look at the problems for which I've assigned.","width":704.3999999761581},{"text":"We cover things in a slightly different order, so there'll be stuff from all over the place; So, there'll be like a final, and there'll be like some midterm 3s and midterm 2s and midterm 1s. ","width":608.3999999761581},{"text":"So, there's going to problems all over the board, but just do the ones that I've suggested, and you should be okay.

If you leave the lab section with your exam, you forfeit your right for a regrade. you can thank the people in the past for that one.","width":1920.3999999761581},{"text":"If you have a regrade request , you need to make it in the same lab section that you receive the exam in.

So that is, I can go into a room and do the exam in two hours and show you that it can be done in two hours and sort of talk about the common errors and sort of what the points in the rubric were.","width":1227.3999999761581},{"text":"I haven't had a chance to secure a room for that yet, but my goal is for that be maybe sometime on sunday like 3 to 5 or something like this. But I need to actually get a room nailed down and I haven't done that yet.

I won't debug your mp for you, but I may talk conceptual issues like if you don't understand what you are supposed to do, that sort of stuff. But I'm not going to \"I have a segfault, here\", I'm not going to debug your code.

So, please look at to be aware of the minor policy changes for office hours.","width":688.3999999761581},{"text":"My goal with that isn't to eliminate your quality time with the TAs.
