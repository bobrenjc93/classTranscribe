[{"text":"I absolutely don't want to discourage you from googling, but I want to discourage you from googling explicitly for the solutions, because that's bad.","width":576},{"text":"Leverage office hours as much as you can. Okay.  ","width":448},{"text":"Prelectures: I sort of mentioned this before jumping into the syllabus. So the prelecture activities will be delivered through the Moodle. I expect you to have viewed them and completed them before the lecture because they cover essential material that we'll be reviewing in the lecture. ","width":896},{"text":"I aim to have these lectures to be more in a flipped (?) style so this is probably the last time where I'll sit here and talk at you at length for more than like five minutes. ","width":512},{"text":"At the end of every prelecture I'm going to give you a form that you can fill in and ask me any questions that you have. ","width":512},{"text":"Of course I'll do my best to answer those questions at the beginning of lecture. ","width":320},{"text":"Unfortunately the script that I had for downloading those from Moodle apparently no longer worked. ","width":640},{"text":"I'll try and fix that if I can by tomorrow. ","width":320},{"text":"Go to lectures. These worksheets: make sure you're filling in your netid on them, and then when the lecture is over just leave them on the table and walk out, and then I'll sweep by and collect them all. They will be graded on completion and then handed back in the lab sections. ","width":1152},{"text":"In the lab sections, I expect you to attend every lab. Lab attendance is required for all graded labs. The lab tomorrow is not graded, but is designed to help you start getting used to how the labs are going to work and making sure that you iron everything out with your accounts and stuff that you can actually complete them and hit the ground running. ","width":1472},{"text":"The very first homework is going to be due on Wednesday: Homework 0. So you need to be able to make sure you have SVN working and that you know how to commit. ","width":640},{"text":"And the very first lab is going to be due on Saturday. So make sure that you're going to every lab. ","width":576},{"text":"The labs are small assignments that are designed to be completed within the lab sections, so you should be able to if you leverage out all the resources like the people around you. You're allowed to collaborate in the labs--that's fine--so leverage like the people sitting at the desks around you, leverage the course staff, and you should be able to complete the lab during the lab section. ","width":1344},{"text":"The goal of the lab is again to give you a little bit more programming experience. They will be a little bit more closely aligned to the lectures most of the time. ","width":768},{"text":"The labs are not for completing the homework and MPs, so I will ask the course staff to prioritize lab questions over MP questions, so if you're in a lab section and you're trying to ask a question about a homework but there's like five other people that are just trying to do the lab, they're not going to answer the MP question; they're going to answer the five people who are trying to do the lab. ","width":1408},{"text":"Go to the lab sections with the expectation that you're going to be doing the lab in the lab section. ","width":320},{"text":"If you have MP questions, go to the office hours, because the office hours are for the MPs. ","width":384},{"text":"[Question about when lab assignments will be released] Conditioned on my ability to get them out. ","width":512},{"text":"So most of the time you'll see the lab sections like literally after I just finished them. ","width":704},{"text":"So maybe, and before as in like a day before or as in like the day of?","width":704},{"text":"It might be the day of, like in the morning. But again, it depends on when I actually get around to releasing it, so I won't make any promises. ","width":768},{"text":"No solutions will be posted for the labs. ","width":448},{"text":"All the labs will be consistently due at 11, two days after the lab section, so you do have time after the lab to finish it up if you didn't finish, but you should be able to get the vast majority of it done during the lab, if not getting it completely done during the lab. ","width":1600},{"text":"They will be autograded using the same autograding system that we use for everything in the class. ","width":384},{"text":"No late submissions are accepted because, again, it's already been autograded. ","width":512},{"text":"Labs taking place before exam dates are reserved for exam review, so if you're looking for an exam review section, that's it. So if you go to the lab the day before the exams, that'll be a review session.  ","width":1024},{"text":"I encourage you to go to those prepared with questions to ask them, because if you go there just expecting them to review material for you, it doesn't help as much. ","width":640},{"text":"Go in there armed with questions ready to interrogate and then they'll field any questions you have about anything. ","width":832},{"text":"MPs: So the MPs make up the bulk of the programming assignments for the class. These are the big ones. These are due roughly one a week. ","width":768},{"text":"Depending on the assignment, it's either going to be a solo MP, meaning you must work individually, on your own, with no one else in the class, with no one else who has taken the class before--your only collaborator can be course staff; or a partner MP, which means (1) \"partner\" means \"two,\" so two people working on one assignment, that's it, not a group of three, not a group of four, not a group of two partners who happen to talk and then--oh, your code looks exactly the same because you used one submission for it? No, that's plagiarism. ","width":1856},{"text":"Two people in a group is a partner group, and that's okay only on MPs that are marked partner MPs. MPs that are marked solo MPs don't have a partner, because then you're going to be talking with me about why you had a partner on a solo MP. ","width":896},{"text":"So make sure you're looking at that. Each MP is going to be broken into two or three parts depending on the assignments. So some of the ones that have a little bit more material on them may be cut into smaller parts so that you can get a little bit more piecemeal progress on them. ","width":960}]
