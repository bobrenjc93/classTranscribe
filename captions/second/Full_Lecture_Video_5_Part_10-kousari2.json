[{"text":"","width":192},{"text":"It's a little weird, It isn't checking for self assignment, It's checking for am I being assigned into something that has the same value as b.","width":704},{"text":"That could be self assignment, but that could be true for a bunch of other cases, I could have a bunch of other books that happen to be copies of some book before. And those are all going to be equal.","width":896},{"text":"So This isn't a self assignment check.","width":64},{"text":"It would still be fine to not do the clear and the copy in the cases that they're equal, that if statement is not doing a self assignment check anymore. It's true for a whole bunch of other cases than just self assignment. ","width":832},{"text":"It's also really non efficient, Imagine I have the bible on the left and a Dance of Dragons on the right. I have these huge books, and I gonna go through and compare every single line and see if they're equal.","width":1152},{"text":"Or maybe in the pathological case, I've added a random period to the sentence of the bible and the left hand side is the non modified version of the bible and the right hand side is the modified bible,","width":960},{"text":"And the place where it differs is the very last line of Revelations.","width":128},{"text":"So it's going to go through the entire bible comparing these strings, which is going to be very slow, the lines are very long, there is a whole bunch, it's going to take forever to do this comparison, and it's going go to that last period and the last chapter is slightly too long, it's not the same.","width":1280},{"text":"Now you're going to do a copy","width":64},{"text":"So that was totally useless right, all I care about is the case where I am assigning into myself, so this is very inefficient.

If we do what we had before.","width":576},{"text":"One comparison, is this number that number, super fast, there is a hardware instruction for it.","width":576},{"text":"It has practically no runtime penalty at all.","width":128},{"text":"I mean there is a branch, that's basically it. It's not gonna matter if I have to ginormous books that have one character different. If they're not the same object true.","width":832},{"text":"It doesn't matter if they're off by one character or if they're off by three characters.","width":320},{"text":"It's just that they're not the same object","width":256},{"text":"So this is the right way to do a self assignment check. And then tomorrow we will start here. And start talking about really cool c++11/14 features. Move semantics and R value references","width":1024}]
