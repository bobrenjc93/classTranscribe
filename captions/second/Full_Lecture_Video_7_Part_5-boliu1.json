I have got A which is a book.","width":704},{"text":"A book has you know...","width":256},{"text":"It's maybe...2, It's got a length.","width":512},{"text":"This is saying that the book has got two chapters. The first chapter has two...","width":1984},{"text":"two lines in it.","width":128},{"text":"The second chapter has three lines in it.","width":128},{"text":"So I should have then...","width":456},{"text":"... and they are right here...","width":191},{"text":"These are the things.  The objects here are strings.","width":448},{"text":"This is the line... there is a string** remembers so it is array of arrays of strings.","width":454},{"text":"It's a string**.","width":155},{"text":"Then I have got my length here which is just a single dimensional array of numbers.","width":274},{"text":"That tells me the size for each...","width":192},{"text":"Then I've got you know my b here","width":382},{"text":"Which is again gonna be a book.","width":128},{"text":"... b ... each one of those being just oneÂ ","width":1523},{"text":"That is just to make the diagram short.","width":341},{"text":"So this is the picture that we have in mind.","width":282},{"text":"The book has got three things in it, the size, and an array of length, and a two dimensional array of strings.","width":512},{"text":"Ok.","width":64},{"text":"Now we are going to do this concatenation operator so we are going to try and create","width":247},{"text":"More space in the current book to hold all of the chapters the right hand side.","width":320},{"text":"Ok.
