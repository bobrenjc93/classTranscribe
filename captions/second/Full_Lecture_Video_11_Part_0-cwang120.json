[{"text":"Okay, good afternoon, let's go and get started, we're seeming a little empty. Is the lab going over a little bit?","width":1664},{"text":"Seem like, doesn't seem like our normal capacity today. ","width":448},{"text":"Let's start off with a couple of annoncement, first you might be probably very aware of, mp_memory.3 that is all of mp_memory, which include the scoped pointer, the scoped array and  collage class is due tonight at 11.","width":1216},{"text":"You've had the task running on this for the past several nights,  so hopefully your in a particularly good position for that.","width":576},{"text":"Remember that the way that the grading for this homework is that if you horribly break something terribly tonight, ","width":448},{"text":"and you get a zero tonight, it would be okay because, we'll take the maximum of last night's score and tonight's score. So you should be still feel comfortable changing your code,","width":768},{"text":"You'll not get a zero because you accidentally break it the night before. ","width":320},{"text":"Ideal you don't break, but if you do, we do take the maximum of last night's run and this night's run ","width":320},{"text":"Okay, as you all should be very very aware of by now the exam is tomorrow at 7","width":448},{"text":"It's a two hour exam, 7 until 9, the room is Sieble center 0216 which is the lecture you walk by on the way to the lab.","width":768},{"text":"0224. So, it's the one on the right, when you go through those sort of double doors. ","width":448},{"text":"And this room, 1320, this was split between these two rooms. ","width":320},{"text":"The split is on the website by the first letter of your last name.  Hopefully everybody can get that right. ","width":512},{"text":"Historically, people never get that right. ","width":128},{"text":"I'm going to reiterate it, it's by the first letter of your last name.  Not the first letter of your netid, Not the first letter of your first name.","width":448},{"text":"Not the first letter of your middle name, Not the second letter of your middle name","width":192},{"text":"It's the first character of your last name. ","width":320},{"text":"I don't think that's too hard, but for example, I would go to the room mark G because my last name is Geigle which begins with a G. ","width":576},{"text":"So hopefully everybody can go to the right exam room.","width":320},{"text":"If you don't go to the right room, the proctor reserve the right to kick you out, and make you go to the right room.  ","width":256},{"text":"Each room will have a roster of every one who is supposed to be in there, if you're not in the roster to be there to take the exam in that room, the proctor can tell you to go to the other room. ","width":576},{"text":"So, please go to the right room ","width":192},{"text":"Not that hard","width":64},{"text":"Okay,","width":64},{"text":"Those on the website now, so you should be able to go to the exam tab on the course website and see what's the splits are. ","width":384},{"text":"Hopefully by the next exam, will be available and we can all go to the same room and be happy.","width":320},{"text":"But for this exam we do need to be in two different rooms. ","width":192},{"text":"Ok, mp_list, mp_list is released last night. So it's out everybody now the spec is on the website. ","width":512},{"text":"This is a two part solo mp. So, two parts means there is only one extra credit deadline","width":576},{"text":"And that encompasses the entire point of extra credit. That extra credit deadline is due Friday at 11. ","width":576},{"text":"Ideally you could finish that before friday, so that go could go and have fun on the fourth, but if you want to work on the fourth you're welcomed to. ","width":512},{"text":"I'll treat it as 11 pm on Thursday, so I can just be done. But, that's up to you.","width":320},{"text":"The .2 which is all of the mp is gonna be due on Monday at 11.","width":512},{"text":"So we move at a fast pace. So, you'd better wrapping up, empty mp_memory tonight, and  start mp_list right after the exam.","width":512},{"text":"And we will continue at that sort of pace.","width":128},{"text":"it's a solo mp, meaning that you may not work with any other person in the class or who has taken the class in the past. ","width":576},{"text":"Anyone on this mp, it's a solo mp.  ","width":192},{"text":"Usage of any other resources other than your brain, and course staff and piazza is cheating. ","width":384},{"text":"Don't do it. I don't want to have that conversation. ","width":192},{"text":"So, just don't do it. It's a solo mp, please treat it as such.","width":256},{"text":"The purpose of being a solo mp is to make sure that both people in the partnering are able to write assignment on their own. ","width":448},{"text":"Don't want you to go through the all course just having one guy who really like to program, do all of your assignment, and not know how to prgram.","width":448},{"text":"Because that's not going to go well, and not going to do very well on the exam.","width":192},{"text":"So, this is an exercise for you to program an assignment completely on your own.","width":320},{"text":"Now you're not completely on your own, it's kind of misleading to say that, you can still use course stuff, ","width":320},{"text":"there","width":64},{"text":"there are still office hours, there is still piazza, so, you still have a support place. ","width":192},{"text":"But I want you to do this sort of without the help of any other students. ","width":320},{"text":"Please, please, hid that warning. ","width":384},{"text":"Okay, there is a prelecture today, I'm going to go over the questions people have on the prelecture.  ","width":384},{"text":"For the modetwo templete function in the video where I talked about iterator","width":384},{"text":"does the templete parameter iterator taken v iterators or just any that behaves likes iterators. ","width":384},{"text":"This is super important, it's anything that behaves like an iterator, doesn't have to be a iterator class. ","width":320},{"text":"just has to be something, that can be incremented, can be compared for inequality, and can be dereferenced. ","width":512},{"text":"So, could be anything, and that's the beauty of this.","width":192},{"text":"every container class define some class inside of it, maybe not even a class, it could be just a pointer","width":384},{"text":"because we saw that pointers work. ","width":128},{"text":"It defines something inside of it, that accept those functions that responds to those functions and be incremented, ","width":704},{"text":"can be compared for inequality, can be dereferenced, has member access, such as like a pointer, except for ++ move you to the next element.","width":384},{"text":"for normal arrays, ++ is fine because you have a pointer to the array, you ++, it moves over one size of thing it point at. ","width":576},{"text":"So, for arrays this works fine. ","width":128},{"text":"For link list not so fine. If we move forward in the heap memory one size of node, it's not going to give us the next node. ","width":512},{"text":"We have to look at the next pointer. ","width":192},{"text":"So, then we need to have an actual class, that can capsulate what it means to do ++ is to move to the next node by following the next pointer.","width":448},{"text":"So, for some cases the class will be a little complicated, ","width":256},{"text":"And for some classes, the iterator will be very very simple, vector is one of those cases","width":448},{"text":"vector is just an array with the elements always start at zero. So making an iterator for that it just give us a pointer. ","width":320},{"text":"you don't have to do anything complicated there. ","width":128},{"text":"It is important to recognize that function that took those, that iterator templete arguments, ","width":448},{"text":"that templete arguments can be anything, as long as whatever that type is,","width":256},{"text":"accept those, or response to those function calls. that overloads those function calls.
