[{"text":"[Video Playing]","width":9578},{"text":"Okay welcome to CS225 data structures and programming principles.","width":431},{"text":"I am your instructor Chase Geigle. Hopefully you all recognize my voice and have completed the pre-lecture before 10. Because if you didn't, you missed it!","width":608},{"text":"Every lecture for the beginning of this class is going to have pre-lectures so please make sure you make sure you complete the pre-lecture activities before you come to lecture.","width":640},{"text":"I will be lecturing with the assumption that you have seen that material. ","width":199},{"text":"So things might be flying over your head if you haven't looked at that beforehand. ","width":538},{"text":"First i want to sort of do a very quick overview of the syllabus.","width":478},{"text":"And then we can jump right in. If you don't already have a worksheet by the way, they should be in the back two corners by the doors.","width":539},{"text":"That will be consistent throughout the course.","width":414},{"text":"I guess first also introductions, so I've asked some of the course staff to attend if they were able to so here is a collection of course staff.","width":678},{"text":"These guys will be your heroes as you're working through the labs and the MPs so please make sure that you get to know them and that you leverage that resource.","width":606},{"text":"Because it will be invaluable throughout the course. 225 is kind of known to have really really great course staff.","width":1232},{"text":"Good morning everyone my name is Rohan, I worked here last semester as well and after talking to Chase I frankly believe the stuff that we cover in the Summer is much more relevant to the industry that you are trying to go into.","width":932},{"text":"Because what we teach in the normal semesters is like C++ 03","width":326},{"text":"And what chase will be teaching you will be C++ 11 stuff which is much more useful if you go into industry.","width":439},{"text":"even though the course is paced pretty fast, I would suggest you start early on your MPs and your labs.","width":649},{"text":"We will always be there to help you out and you can always post stuff on Piazza","width":303},{"text":"Don't underestimate the power of Piazza. It's really important.","width":433},{"text":"Hi everyone, my name is Sophia and my Chinese name is Xue Ting.","width":354},{"text":"This is a really good course. I took it last Summer and I hope you enjoy it. Thank you.","width":693},{"text":"Hi, I'm Flora. So you should come to office hours and post on Piazza a lot. I'll be on Piazza. ","width":1310},{"text":"Hi guys, my name is chuan and I'll be working with you guys in the summer. Have fun.","width":574},{"text":"Hi everyone, my name is Evening and this is my second time on course staff. So this class is definitely hard. Even when it's the regular semester, not to mention its summer, because you will have two labs and one mp due each week.","width":818},{"text":"But definitely go to office hours. They are great help. And have a fun semester.","width":529},{"text":"Ok thanks guys. You can either stick around if you'd like to or you're free. Everybody else isn't.","width":556},{"text":"So let's go through sort of what this class is about. There are two main topics of this course. Both are kind of interleaved throughout so it's not as though there are two parts of the course. It's kind of there are two main themes but they are intertwined through everything.","width":910},{"text":"The first is of course data structures which is focused on how you actually store your data in computer programs.","width":401},{"text":"One of the most important things in terms of how things run in your program or how efficient your programs are is how you structure your data.","width":573},{"text":"And using the appropriate data structure in the appropriate situation is very very important for running time and memory consumption","width":541},{"text":"And sort of the underpinning for a lot of computer science.","width":334},{"text":"Whether you choose to go in a more theoretical direction or you choose to go in a more practical application direction, you need data structures regardless.","width":529},{"text":"The second main topic is programming principles. The idea here is I'm going to try and expose you to a large number of programing paradigms different techniques for solving problems. So things like Object Oriented Programming but also things like templates and generic programming, operator overloading, etc","width":1231},{"text":"So this is one of the main reasons why we use C++ in the class. Is that we have access to this large collection of programming principles that I can talk to you about.","width":693},{"text":"In particular the manifestation of your programs will be written in C++ 14 so this is the latest standard for the C++ programming language.","width":671},{"text":"And so you should be able to use all of the latest and greatest features that are available in the language.","width":523}]
