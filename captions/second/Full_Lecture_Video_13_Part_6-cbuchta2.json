[{"text":"[silence]","width":1344},{"text":"Argue this base don the invariant that you are maintaining. Which is every new item in the array from N/2 on for an array of size N is going to have 2 dollars associated with it when the resize is necessary.","width":1088},{"text":"Always the case where youll have enough youll never go into debt. If you went into debt, the cost you were associating with the push back operation wasnt big enough. You couldnt save enough money to do this. ","width":832},{"text":"If you try and do bankers methods for 3 dollars for the fixed resize scheme. The add D cells it wont work out. You have to give more money than just a fixed constant in order for that to work.","width":960},{"text":"So bankers method will tell you that theres not a fixed cost you can associate with that. Youd have to associate a cost with it thats proportional to the number of things that are in the array. ","width":576},{"text":"You have to give them N dollars instead of 3 dollars. Then your amortized cost is linear instead of constant. Does that make sense?","width":576},{"text":"This is just another way of thinking about it. If the aggregate analysis makes more sense to you use that. If this makes more sense to you, use this.","width":512},{"text":"Theyre both equally valid. They are 2 methods of doing amortized analysis that are used in the algorithms course as well. Theres also another one i wont touch on but if youre interested in that stuff its called the potential method and it involves coming up with a function that measures the potential energy of your data structure.","width":1216},{"text":"By assigning energy to every state and as you do things the disorder of the system increases and you use the difference between the disorder between the system at state T and T+1 to bound what the amortized cost of that state should be.","width":1024},{"text":"But doing so was sort of a theoretical sledge hammer we dont need that in this case.Good.","width":896},{"text":"Moving on.","width":512},{"text":"Okay, one of my favorites. I love exams questions like this so just as a good warning. I love exam questions where you have to think and design a data structure even if its something you havent seen before. This is kind of cheating because if youve gone to lab youve seen this data structure but if you havent gone to lab yet this is completely fair.","width":1344},{"text":"So pretend this is an exam. And weve talked about lists and thats it. Lists and vectors and this const resizing stuff but thats it. ","width":704},{"text":"I want you to design a data structure which provides the following ADT functions: Push(T) which adds the element to the structure. ","width":576},{"text":"Pop which removes an element from the structure doesnt return anything.","width":256},{"text":"And peek which tells me what the next element which will be removed is.","width":512},{"text":"We can add things to the structure. I can remove things form the structure. And i can see whats about to be removed from the structure.","width":576},{"text":"But notice here that theres no way for me to look inside. I dont have a way of iterating. Theres not an  at, no iterators.","width":768},{"text":"It doesnt even tell me what the size is, which would also be useful.","width":384},{"text":"But i cant iterate over it. Thats the key. I cant iterate over this structure. Its doesnt have an operative brackets or a dot at. Its just add things, remove things, check the thing thats about to be removed is. What is the next thing coming out of this structure. ","width":1216},{"text":"And furthermore the first element to be removed that is what im going to remove next. Is going to be the most recent one inserted.  ","width":768},{"text":"Knowing that and knowing nothing else. Work with a buddy and go through A. what is this removing at every pop operation. [silence].","width":7232},{"text":"Hopefully this is making sense. So what is this removing? The easiest way to think about this is as always to draw a picture. So I want the first thing to come off of this thing to be the most recent thing inserted. What physical thing is this like?","width":1536},{"text":"A stack of books or something. The next im gonna pull of is the thing thats on the top.","width":384},{"text":"I cant, im not gonna go and flip it over and pull of this one. its always gonna be whatever i added to the top of this thing first. ","width":576},{"text":"So im gonna draw a picture that looks exactly like that.","width":448},{"text":"This picture should look familiar. Okay. ","width":320},{"text":"Push 1. Okay im gonna add 1 to this structure.","width":576},{"text":"Push 2 im gonna put 2 on top. 3 im gonna put 3 on top.","width":448},{"text":"So then im gonna do a pop. What am i popping? 1,2 or 3? 3 its the last thing i put in.","width":576},{"text":"Push a 4, pop, 4. ","width":320},{"text":"Pop, 2.","width":128},{"text":"Push 5. Pop 5. Pop 1.","width":384}]
