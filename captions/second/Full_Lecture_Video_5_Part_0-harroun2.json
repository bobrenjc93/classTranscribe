[{"text":"Alright. Let's go ahead and get started. First thing I want to point out is I forgot to section on the top of the worksheet for putting in your lab. Please do that because that's how I'm going to sort them to get them back to you because sorting the first two was a nightmare because I forgot to have you write down your lab. Despite the fact I derped and forgot to put a lab part on the top of the worksheet, please do fill in your lab section. ","width":2084.6666666269302},{"text":"That ensures that you'll get it back in lab because I assume you'll want these back. Also, of course don't forget your netid as usual. I've had a couple that just don't have netids, and I don't know what I'm supposed to do with those.","width":1023.6666666269302},{"text":"Other announcements: apologizes for no notice on this one but I'm going to have a debug your brain session right after lecture today in the basement of Siebel with all those chairs. I'm going to be there. This are sort of pen and paper office hours. I'm not going to sit down and help you debug your seg faults or anything, but it's there for anybody that's having any issues figuring out what the heck is going on in lecture.","width":1989.6666666269302},{"text":"Come with any questions you want to pepper me with. I don't have anything prepared so it's just going to be student driven, but if you have specific questions about stuff, please go to that so I can get them straightened out.","width":767.6666666269302},{"text":"There's an awful lot of material that we power through in this first week, so if you have any questions about that please go to that if you can. It'll be right after lecture.","width":959.6666666269302},{"text":"My other DYB is I think on Friday, and then I'll start having it normally on Friday. I didn't get it scheduled in time last week so I'm having it now.","width":1023.6666666269302},{"text":"Lab debug was due on Saturday. I just haven't run the grader for that so I'll do that and you'll get grades for that. It's not like there is an extended deadline or anything. It was due when it was due so I'll do that soon. Mp memory will come out today at some point. I just have to finish making the modifications to it that I want to.","width":1433.6666666269302},{"text":"The start of it has a bunch of stuff that we're going to cover in the first couple days of this week. If you see it, and you're like \"what the heck\", don't worry. We're going to cover it.","width":831.6666666269302},{"text":"It has the stuff from tomorrow. It has stuff from Wednesday. But there's enough information in the assignment specification that you should just be able to read it and be like \"okay, sure I'll believe you for now\" and then you'll tell me about it in lecture. You don't actually need to know all of the specifics before you dive into that assignment. The first part is super super easy but super super important.","width":1732.6666666269302},{"text":"I'm still on the fence on whether to make this a partner mp or not. If I do decide to make this a partner mp, if you're working with your partner on the first part, make sure you both write it. Not just have your partner write part one because if you do that you're going to miss the material that I expect you to get practice with and then you're going to be clueless for the rest of the semester on that particular thing.","width":1454.6666666269302},{"text":"So I want you to at least even if you're working with a partner do the first part kind of independently. Make sure you've written it yourself so that you have that experience of doing that. THe very first thing we're going to do is write a very useful very small very easy but very useful abstraction that we're then going to use for pretty much the rest of the course.  So I want to be very aware of how that works. Make sure that you're doing that. If you have any questions about how it's working or why certain things are the way they are in that thing, ask on piazza or in office hours because that's like super important. ","width":2495.6666666269302},{"text":"HW0 is like in the process of being graded. I think but don't know that it will be coming in lab tomorrow. If not, you'll get it back on Thursday. We're shooting for Tuesday but I don't know where we are with respect to that. I know that it's being graded.","width":1407.6666666269302},{"text":"Quick couple of prelecture stuff. We'll go over the very last prelecture question. To answer a lot of them, the answer should have said it makes an extra copy. It does of course actually try to do a copy, that's the point of the assignment. It is doing a copy. I meant to say is it doing more copying than the one that is in the video.","width":2431.6666666269302},{"text":"The answer is it is not. I apologize for the slightly confusing wording in the question. If you read the answer when you do get the right answer, and you read what I said then it makes sense because I said it's not doing more copying than the one in the video. But I should have said that in the question. So I meant it makes an extra copy. It tries to copy the parameter before it makes the assignment. Sorry for the wording in that.","width":1919.6666666269302},{"text":"There was a lot going on in that, so we will sort of touch on that because we're going to write an assignment operator. I'll show you a wrong way to do it, and then we can talk about what's wrong with this. Let me count the ways. What does return *this mean? Remember that this if you're inside of a member function.. First of all return *this only means something if you're inside the member function of a class. Otherwise, this has no meaning because what is this. This is always going to be a pointer to the current instance of an object if you're inside of that object. So if you're in a member function of an object, this is going to be initialized to point at the object of which that method is being called.","width":2623.6666666269302},{"text":"So return *this means return the current object, so in the assignment operator we return the current object when we're done assigning into it. The reason for that is you can chain assignments. I don't recommend it, but you can. You can say like A=B=C.","width":959.6666666269302},{"text":"That equal operator needs to return something for that last assignment to be valid.","width":353.66666662693024},{"text":"A=B=C you should assign C into B and then return B that's been assigned and then assign that into A. So you need to return something out of that. Again we will hit on that in the actual lecture. Don't worry about it too much.","width":959.6666666269302},{"text":"Was it a typo to omit the parameter name in gallery.h? So I had functions in gallery.h and I didn't actually name the parameter. I just said a type. So I said something like const gallery ref and I just didn't give it a name. That's fine as long as it's in the header. If it's in the definition, I need to have the variables that I'm referring to. If I don't give it a name, it will still compile but I can't refer to the argument anymore. In the header file it's fine to omit the name of the parameter. It's not a typo it's okay. Typically I don't do that, but I'll do that when I'm crammed for space. So when I really need that extra three pixels, I'm going to try and omit parameter names. It's not actually a bug.","width":3327.6666666269302}]
