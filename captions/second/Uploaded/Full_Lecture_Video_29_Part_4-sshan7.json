Yup?","width":258},{"text":"Okay, tilda actually is is a cheat that's actually part of the shell","width":333},{"text":"So that so tilda is expanded already.

","width":224},{"text":"Maybe we follow a symbolic link so we go to the file yeah awesome","width":520},{"text":"dot text which actually resolves to our original file","width":322},{"text":"So how do I know that these files are actually referred to the same thing?","width":233},{"text":"The answer is we need to reduce them down to the canonical form","width":256},{"text":"and the beautiful thing about a canonical form is that if you have a canonical path and I have a canonical path","width":403},{"text":"and they are identical then they must refer to the same file","width":355},{"text":"Why? cause that's the definition of a canonical path","width":361},{"text":"So is uhh it's not necessary an absolute path. Not all absolute paths are canonical","width":496},{"text":"but you can be sure that if two canonical paths are identical, they are talking about the same file","width":502},{"text":"right how do I get the canonical path?","width":157},{"text":"Well you give me any path you want","width":395},{"text":"I'll call realpath on it","width":150},{"text":"it will follow that follow any sym links that you happen to refer to follow any dot dots etc etc etc","width":403},{"text":"and then finally it'll give me an actual path. I can use that and later I'll just free it","width":701},{"text":"You can pass in a buffer but in practice don't bother just let malloc make sure it gives you enough path enough space","width":498},{"text":"Now I mentioned this because actually we can use this for security","width":218},{"text":"suppose you were to make a web server you probably don't want a web server to be able to serve all possible files","width":651},{"text":"on your hard disk drive","width":197},{"text":"Cause if it can, you bet your dollar I'm going to be looking for slash etc slash password","width":465},{"text":"Aight. Or your ssh uh private key","width":318},{"text":"we'll try to download that","width":389},{"text":"And in fact, these kinds of tricks are used to escape the current directory or the root of the webserver","width":487},{"text":"and uh we want to try to prevent that so one way when you're checking directories is to convert it into a canonical path","width":452},{"text":"and then check that it actually truly starts with the based directory that you care about","width":460},{"text":"so for example the user is trying to get an image from your image directory ","width":217},{"text":"not trying to download your password file as an image","width":451},{"text":"I've encountered numerous server programs that don't do this check","width":329},{"text":"so for example, uh I can get a printer to include using uh postscript and other commands","width":462},{"text":"to include a local file from the printer and therefore print out the printer's own password and other information you want about the printer","width":412},{"text":"whoops","width":217},{"text":"So anyways so thats so real path next time we want to write a robust server, remember this it's useful security tool","width":576}]
