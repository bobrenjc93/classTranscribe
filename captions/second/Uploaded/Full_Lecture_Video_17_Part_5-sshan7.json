","width":79},{"text":"well we're gonna need our pthread mutex lock calls and let's pass in...","width":423},{"text":"variable and we'll... course we'll need that","width":383},{"text":"inside our add method as well and at the end","width":216},{"text":"i'll need a pthread mutex unlock","width":341},{"text":"if I could spell it, there we go, all right","width":459},{"text":"okay","width":78},{"text":"And you might say \"oh hold on a moment, you didn't stop pthread mutex lock correctly.\"","width":224},{"text":"That's okay, with vim I can do regular expressions, where I can say things like ","width":373},{"text":"Substitute on all lines","width":194},{"text":"p_m for pthread_mutex","width":306},{"text":"and do it global on each line so if there is more than one match per line, don't do it so... so there we go. right um, so okay right","width":693},{"text":"We haven't done condition variables yet though so the next thing is rather than doing a spin loop, ","width":288},{"text":"we wanna go to sleep, and guess what?
