[{"text":"Alright, another thing we're going to finish today is epoll.","width":558},{"text":"So I suggest for a simple server, hey, just uh, just little while loop.","width":296},{"text":"The next simple server is: hey make a thread so at least we can do this with uh multiple threads so that I can be servicing two clients at the same time.threads so","width":751},{"text":"Well, these kinds of ideas work until now you have hundreds or thousands of clients connected to it at the same time.","width":513},{"text":"And um, a bit of history is that we used to have a core called \"select\" you'll find in everywhere (works in a mac), but these days, epoll is a common solution to a hyperbolic server; in fact, you'll get to play with that this section.","width":1153},{"text":"And what epoll will ask you to do is with sockets or pipes, and you'll get to play with pipes.","width":455},{"text":"You can say, \"Actually, there's a whole load of file descriptors that I'm interested in.\"","width":338},{"text":"And so, the basic outline of epoll is: you make, we make a set you'll create, and then, using a control function we add a whole load of file descriptors, a whole load of file descriptors.","width":1541},{"text":"You say you'd want to read or write to these. What's your intent?","width":836},{"text":"And then you can wait--wait for an event.","width":477},{"text":"That's the basic idea.","width":126},{"text":"So actually now, I can have a single thread waiting on a thousand clients.","width":375},{"text":"If my clients don't talk to me very much, when one of them does, I can immediately find out which one.","width":500},{"text":"...because epoll call will tell me, \"Hey! By the way, now you have to talk to this particular file descriptor, now you need to be talking to this particular file descriptor.\"","width":502},{"text":"The old way of using select: will select allow me to go to sleep once something is happening; but once select returns, I'd have to kind of go through every single file descriptor. I'd have to do a linear search to find out which file descriptor was the one that I need to process.","width":1348},{"text":"So, that would be in session this week with epoll, and the other section thing we hope to do with sections tomorrow is to connect some class 7 code on the tablets as well.","width":877},{"text":"With that, have a wonderful week! Good luck with the MPs! I'll see you on Friday <3","width":384}]
