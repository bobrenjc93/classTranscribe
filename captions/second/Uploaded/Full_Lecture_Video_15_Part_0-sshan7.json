[{"text":"programs that we have you'd be paid 15 dollars an hour for your time and make roughly over a thousand dollars upon completion","width":932},{"text":"last year we did the same study but we've tweaked it and modified it a fair amount","width":356},{"text":"a lot of people really enjoyed this study, they found it was a really great way start exercising, they met a lot of people and being paid 15 dollars an hour to do anything is pretty great","width":634},{"text":"so if you're interested, you can visit our website, insight.beckman.illinois.edu","width":444},{"text":"chris out there has handed out fliers to a bunch of you so if you want to write down any of the information from your neighbor you can do that as well cause we happened to run out of fliers","width":610},{"text":"and you need to be here during the summer in order to participate in this study","width":235},{"text":"so I don't really have a lot of time to speak so does anybody have any questions? any?","width":527},{"text":"alright, thank you for your time","width":306},{"text":"great, so alright so back okay woo cool great","width":557},{"text":"here's one of the things I was talking about in orange county and by the way yes I did bring some warm weather back with me, it's coming this week","width":518},{"text":"actually next week, we'll have a much warmer weather","width":280},{"text":"but anyways this is one of the things I was talking about was how do you run a course where your introduce android programming to absolute beginners and in doing so get the word out that illinois is actually a pretty good place to study computer science","width":912},{"text":"and this is what we did, there were fun lectures, there were students in my lectures, some of them not even CS students but I had a singer song writer","width":567},{"text":"we went to spurlock and saw bardeen's first transistor and then being an engineer of course, he wanted to make not one but two transistors","width":599},{"text":"so that's a music box there right in the middle","width":179},{"text":"and that was fantastic right to actually be able to amplify sound using a small device brought the convention down when bardeen first demonstrated this","width":614},{"text":"and by the way he actually did a drinking song","width":221},{"text":"he played a music note on this and this is during the dry period","width":313},{"text":"so that's how he got his propaganda out that the transistor was a good thing","width":223},{"text":"and then here's me underneath singing the fifty words of java as a song parody","width":394},{"text":"right so we talked about the fact that look programming is hard and had students say things like yeah I built an app and it didn't work","width":472},{"text":"I built another app and it didn't work either and this idea that look programming is a lot about problem solving","width":360},{"text":"yes you have to have the technical knowledge but it's a lot about being like a detective and looking at a crime scene and trying to figure out why did it not work","width":546},{"text":"and then up there in the thinking bubble is another engineering student with his hair going everywhere because he's actually trying to decode at thirty thousand feet as the plane plumets because its simulating zero G","width":810},{"text":"it's simulating being out of space, it's on a gravity dice so that was a lot of fun a couple of years ago","width":363},{"text":"right so anyways, so that's what I was doing and as you saw from the notes, professor rutenbar and also someone from the provost office was there as well","width":672},{"text":"chuck tucker","width":48},{"text":"right so let's now head on over to CS241 content but before that has anyone got any quick questions about this?","width":662},{"text":"no? okay right so let's do today","width":457},{"text":"so I hear you talked about [something] yes? last week with Robin? yeah","width":672},{"text":"we're going to continue thinking about deadlock today but I'm also going to give you some hints about the next MP","width":511},{"text":"which is to make a fast merge sort, a multithreaded merge sort","width":452},{"text":"so first of all let's review a little problem here","width":828},{"text":"and see what we can remember about the coffman conditions","width":758},{"text":"I've got three gardeners walking into a garden shed to start their work","width":227},{"text":"they are after some resources right and so they are going to pick up their tools for the day","width":307},{"text":"in other words they are about to request some resources","width":296},{"text":"obviously we have a potential for a deadlock, we might have two gardeners try to pick up the same shovel or something","width":350},{"text":"okay fortunately we know about coffman conditions","width":280},{"text":"alright so how can we assure that we are avoid deadlock","width":299},{"text":"I want you to through the mists of time remember yes there are four coffman conditions","width":290},{"text":"now here's the challenge, can you actually write down at least one of them","width":361},{"text":"or better, can between you and your neighbor actually write all four without looking them up","width":453},{"text":"make a list, make a list of four items, see if you can remember what they are","width":224},{"text":"what are the conditions for deadlock? if your neighbors not sure, ask another neighbor","width":563},{"text":"[silence]","width":2712},{"text":"right, the best way to learn to remember things is to try to remember things","width":320},{"text":"if you want to program your brain to say hey this stuff is important","width":245},{"text":"and I want to be able to remember this stuff, the best way to do that is to actually keep remembering it, to actually tell your brain oh yeah yeah i'm actually trying to access this information","width":530},{"text":"if you keep doing this, it's going to go into your long term storage","width":212},{"text":"yes cramming for tests gives you a short term cram, it puts stuff into your short term memory","width":344},{"text":"it's good enough for about 6 hours to 24 hours but it does not go into your long term memory","width":398},{"text":"it gets wiped pretty quickly","width":201},{"text":"so if you really actually want to learn this stuff then don't just cram for tests but actually exercise your brain","width":343},{"text":"it's really the practice, just to start with a piece of paper and say hey what do I know about subject X? write it all down","width":359},{"text":"throw that piece of paper away, do it again on a different day","width":218},{"text":"you're telling your brain this stuff is important to me I need to access stuff","width":255},{"text":"um so, right what have we got?","width":333},{"text":"okay first of all let's see give me a hands up if you managed to get at least one","width":407},{"text":"okay hands up if you've got two","width":85},{"text":"hands up if you've got three","width":67},{"text":"hands up if you've got four","width":87},{"text":"alright hands up if you haven't... ah nvm, nice let's keep going","width":383},{"text":"here's one we should know right? mutual exclusion","width":304},{"text":"exclusive access","width":258},{"text":"we need non sharable resources","width":654},{"text":"in other words, if my gardeners are all friendly and they say oh no no let's all use this shovel together","width":432},{"text":"then there won't be any deadlock","width":171},{"text":"but instead of course they're like no I'm grabbing this shovel and get your own","width":438},{"text":"so first of all we need exclusive access","width":128}]
