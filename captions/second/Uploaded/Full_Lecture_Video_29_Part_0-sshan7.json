[{"text":"Alright. Good afternoon class. Where are you? There we go. Alright. Hi","width":593},{"text":"So uh last night I had some fun uh making this uh camera preview.","width":347},{"text":"Uh. Normally when you set up a camera preview in android uh ","width":247},{"text":"For speed, you don't get to see the bytes.","width":200},{"text":"You don't see the actual pixels.","width":140},{"text":"Here's why. Memory is really really slow and when you start looking images","width":273},{"text":"typically you're talking about uh a million bytes or more","width":228},{"text":"Uh and uh uhhhhhh working with that in in Java and copying it from buffer to buffer ","width":445},{"text":"is going to make any kind of preview mode very very slow","width":341},{"text":"Um just as an example, uh a typically CPU these days can execute about 215 instructions per","width":553},{"text":"Sorry 250 per instructions per main memory access","width":345},{"text":"Versus say level 1 where it can do about 4 instructions per main uh per level 1 cache access","width":507},{"text":"Right so um I didn't want that thought I actually to get the bytes from the preview ","width":338},{"text":"and uh finally I finally got it working last night. So we'll be playing with this in uh","width":268},{"text":"section uh tomorrow.","width":164},{"text":"Uh","width":47},{"text":"Theeeeeeee plan,","width":146},{"text":"We'll see if I get it working and then if I can't then it's your turn","width":161},{"text":"Is to uh make a webserver that's part of this app","width":342},{"text":"So that the webserver actually is uhhh got a back end interface into an application","width":387},{"text":"This isn't quite as crazy as it sounds. In fact,","width":164},{"text":"many of programs now uh have an in built webserver so that you can interrogate ","width":440},{"text":"uhhh the current state of the program so","width":185},{"text":"for example if you're developing a game,","width":123},{"text":"You might consider a webserver as an alternative way in into the kinda back end of your your","width":389},{"text":"game engine so you could look at stats that the program is running","width":190},{"text":"you could change things as so as the program is running","width":169},{"text":"you could even build a complete a small interpreter so you could say quickly set where the","width":316},{"text":"uhhh where the players are or load a particular state file","width":231},{"text":"so that kind of thing","width":72},{"text":"I've seen it done with uh gas chromachaffs as well where there's a main screen","width":306},{"text":"and then there's a behind the scenes webserver which you can connect to ","width":157},{"text":"if you know the port and maybe a password","width":111},{"text":"Uh so again you can check the status of the engine or the program as it's running","width":361},{"text":"So as planned is can we make a webserver that is part of this camera preview","width":254},{"text":"and then we'll use it to actually share","width":181},{"text":"The image","width":93},{"text":"Alright so.","width":72},{"text":"We'll make our bit of kind of spyware so that anyone that knows the port number","width":293},{"text":"can actually look at the uh the current preview that's going on.","width":219},{"text":"right","width":28},{"text":"So that's what we're going to make. Ummm","width":202},{"text":"Now today, we're gonna talk about uhh files andd uhhh this kinda one really really really big idea","width":465},{"text":"and it's gonna this kind of misconception I want to clear up today","width":132},{"text":"that a file name is NOT a file","width":175},{"text":"and it's an easy trap that we get called into because we think like that all day long","width":270},{"text":"we think, open this file and here's the name","width":271},{"text":"Right","width":45},{"text":"If you could walk out of this lecture","width":114},{"text":"Not believing that anymore, then, you made significant progress","width":290},{"text":"Instead what I want you to think of isss","width":158},{"text":"that a file is an i node","width":160},{"text":"That, a file is just the bytes, just the content","width":266},{"text":"Forget for a moment that it has a name","width":165},{"text":"Forget that it lives inside a directory","width":175},{"text":"Forget that it lives inside a hierarchy","width":321},{"text":"That's all icing the cake, which we're gonna do seperately from the actual file","width":517},{"text":"Right. So how do we think of files?","width":163},{"text":"Think of them as just a particular inode","width":196},{"text":"and remember this is how we're going to organize our space on the disk","width":209},{"text":"Where we initially format it, uhh we'll have a super block","width":250},{"text":"SUPER BLOCK","width":54},{"text":"But the super block is just a managed information about how we've actually organized this data","width":383},{"text":"And in fact on real disks, disk information is so critical to be able to get anything done","width":292},{"text":"It's actually replicated several times throughout the disk ","width":180},{"text":"Just in case uh we get um a cosmic ray or some other effect which obliterates this particular copy","width":393},{"text":"But anyways super block tells us, how many say inodes we've got","width":175},{"text":"and and where the very first data block block starts","width":185},{"text":"Right. So. If we're using an inode. That means we've stored a file on our disk","width":408},{"text":"And remember we looked at last time that each inode might have some","width":242},{"text":"Direct entries","width":92},{"text":"HEY here's the content","width":70},{"text":"and we'll have say about ten of those","width":290},{"text":"But if we want to store larger files,","width":133},{"text":"Then the game we play is we store a reference a data block that is not actually used for data","width":314},{"text":"It's used just to hold pointers to actually data blocks","width":197},{"text":"And if we have a larger file, we play this game twice","width":180},{"text":"we have now, a reference to a data block","width":167},{"text":"That it to itself contains pointers to yet more tables of pointers","width":257},{"text":"And then finally huge file, ","width":206},{"text":"Then we play this game three times, thriple indirection block","width":169},{"text":"and that's it, we don't play after that. Right? We don't try to. We don't have quad indirection blocks","width":294},{"text":"Right so that's our contents of our inodes","width":120},{"text":"and you remember that inodes have more than just these pointers, ","width":264},{"text":"they have a little bit of information as well, a little meta information like the file size","width":214},{"text":"ummm, ahhh who owns the file.","width":269},{"text":"And as we'll see in a little bit","width":166},{"text":"Guess what? you could basically, from C,","width":221},{"text":"Discover what's in the inode.","width":204},{"text":"And uh.","width":137},{"text":"Including the inode number,","width":242},{"text":"And remember we talked about some of these things like,","width":129},{"text":"Who saw it, when was it last accessed, when was it last modified?","width":206},{"text":"When it last changed?","width":202},{"text":"And","width":86},{"text":"Total number of bytes","width":192}]
