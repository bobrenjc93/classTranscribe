I don't know what happened to the 'n'","width":196},{"text":"right, but it's umount","width":107},{"text":"okay, so we better find the thing to umount","width":182},{"text":"alright, so here's my mount, I just want to find things to do","width":230},{"text":"with that .iso, so let's take the output of mount","width":199},{"text":"pipe it into the input of grep","width":198},{"text":"and grep will only print me lines that match my pattern","width":244},{"text":"so I'm going to look for things that match .iso","width":231},{"text":"here it is, that one line, that saves me a bit of eye search trying to find it","width":290},{"text":"okay, so now I can umount on angrave/demo2/stuff2","width":1089},{"text":"did I miss something?","width":219},{"text":"oh cs241 thank you","width":393},{"text":"It's busy?!?!","width":141},{"text":"Why is it busy?","width":421},{"text":"I'll give you a hint:","width":424},{"text":"we're currently in there, that's currently our directory","width":187},{"text":"so the kernal says, \"I'm sorry","width":121},{"text":"someone's using this device right now, I can't let you unmount that","width":286},{"text":"because I've got another process trying to read its contents\"","width":184},{"text":"So let me go up one directory","width":280},{"text":"okay, so now I've unmounted it","width":474},{"text":"there we go","width":84},{"text":"and now there's nothing let inside stuff, we're back to an empty directory again","width":452},{"text":"okay so we're seeing the","width":90},{"text":"lifestyle, sorry, the lifecycle of mounting and unmounting","width":322},{"text":"we've played with grep","width":83},{"text":"now let's play with some virtual filesystems","width":1065},{"text":"alright so if you ever want to just clear the screen","width":69},{"text":"clear is useful, if you've messed up your terminal","width":160},{"text":"reset tries to do some things reasonable","width":646},{"text":"let's have a look at a couple of these files","width":224},{"text":"let's have a look at, say, hex dump of zero","width":388},{"text":"if I start reading from /dev/zero","width":181},{"text":"I can just get a whole load of zeros","width":184},{"text":"If I read from /dev/null","width":195},{"text":"there's nothing, it's completely empty","width":196},{"text":"but they're not the most exciting ones, let's have a look at","width":754},{"text":"so next time you want to write a","width":309},{"text":"secure program, and you need some","width":235},{"text":"secure random numbers, numbers which are actually difficult to guess","width":344},{"text":"/dev/random is your choice","width":221},{"text":"you could open this, and read from","width":247},{"text":"this directory, and it will give you back random bytes","width":243},{"text":"random bytes that are difficult for an adversory to guess in advance","width":379},{"text":"how does the operating system generate these numbers?","width":242},{"text":"by collecting entropy","width":177},{"text":"okay what is entropy?","width":96},{"text":"well, things like external things can happen to my system","width":183},{"text":"so for example, let me press the Shift key","width":204},{"text":"and of course, I can't , because I'm not on that machine","width":305},{"text":"uh, so what I can do on that machine is","width":232},{"text":"look for arriving network packets","width":263},{"text":"let me try to generate from random entropy","width":137},{"text":"and slowly, when it's got enough entropy, there we go","width":370},{"text":"it can give you some more random data","width":152},{"text":"so not only does it need to generate random data, it needs to actually keep","width":302},{"text":"the meta information about just how much randomness has it collected at this point","width":545},{"text":"well look at that, lots of stuff must be happening","width":257},{"text":"maybe the disk drive is going, maybe there's some additional network packets happening","width":234},{"text":"but it's run out of entropy, so it blocks","width":191},{"text":"so it cannot give me anymore bytes at this point without um","width":331},{"text":"it cannot reliably give me more bytes at this point which are random","width":255},{"text":"so /dev/random is useful if","width":243},{"text":"you really want to wait until you've got cryptographically secure bytes","width":262},{"text":"if you don't need cryptographically secure bytes","width":170},{"text":"if you're prepared to just accept some limitations, then use urandom","width":257},{"text":"and that will just happily stream","width":115},{"text":"random bytes to you all day long","width":413},{"text":"so off we go","width":94},{"text":"by the way, with hexdump, you can even ask to see the characters aswell","width":230},{"text":"here we go, and perhaps if we waited long enough, we'd see Shakespere","width":540},{"text":"so that's one way to generate a lot of random numbers very very quickly","width":477},{"text":"we can find some things out about my machine here, lets go into","width":341},{"text":"/proc now","width":253},{"text":"and first of all, if we do an ls, we can see there's a whole lot of numbers here","width":312},{"text":"and some other interesting files","width":192},{"text":"that are generated by the kernal","width":108},{"text":"these do not exist on the disk drive","width":142},{"text":"this listing of files is generated by the kernal","width":173},{"text":"because we asked for a particular directory","width":120},{"text":"and if we were go to a particular one of these files","width":167},{"text":"again, it's generated on the fly","width":132},{"text":"as we request bytes from these files","width":165},{"text":"so let's have a look at, say, the memory for this file","width":320}]
