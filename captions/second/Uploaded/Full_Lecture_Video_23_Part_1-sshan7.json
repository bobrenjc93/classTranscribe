[{"text":"okay so lets see if we can set this up then","width":540},{"text":"I'm going to start writing some code then to make a TCP conneciton","width":319},{"text":"so yes we need to setup one of these int objects","width":242},{"text":"and we'll have a pointer as well to get the result","width":186},{"text":"so what should i set for the family?","width":508},{"text":"well if i want to connect with version 4 I would be connecting with IF_INET6","width":530},{"text":"if i want to do ip version 6 i would put a 6 in here","width":480},{"text":"and what about the socket","width":95},{"text":"Well we want a stream based protocol","width":151},{"text":"in other words TCP","width":104},{"text":"so for our socket type we specify socket stream","width":439},{"text":"if i had left these entries as zero","width":278},{"text":"we're basically saying hey we don't care","width":154},{"text":"and then we get back that linkedlist","width":145},{"text":"what are you connect to the BBC using the UDP","width":169},{"text":"using um datagrams","width":111},{"text":"you could connect using tcp","width":62},{"text":"and these would just be different entries in that linkedlist","width":271},{"text":"and then your code could try them all","width":116},{"text":"hey lets see if we can get a webpage over udp","width":212},{"text":"and the answer is actually quite a few webservers will do that","width":201},{"text":"they'll look at you strangely and go what do you want?","width":153},{"text":"but they will actually say okay I'll give you back some data as a single packet","width":354},{"text":"right so right we're going to fill this in","width":315},{"text":"ok so what do we put in here","width":148},{"text":"our function call of course is get address info","width":375},{"text":"and what do we pass over here","width":83},{"text":"well we need to pass in the hints","width":274},{"text":"and we need to pass in our reult","width":301},{"text":"okay, so lets see if your neighbor can first of all the mistakes i've just deliberately made in that code","width":606},{"text":"and also what are the two missing things that I need to fill in here","width":421},{"text":"what are the first two parameters","width":164},{"text":"so what mistakes did I make and what's missing in that code","width":6645},{"text":"okay right so ","width":178},{"text":"couple a mistakes we made","width":80},{"text":"first of all actually we want the address of our hint struct","width":205},{"text":"so we'll put an ampersand there","width":117},{"text":"and also we want the address of this pointer","width":179},{"text":"it's going to change that pointer for us","width":348},{"text":"ok so what do we pass in here?","width":132},{"text":"well we pass in sometimes it's called the node but you can think of it as just basically the machine we want to connect to","width":368},{"text":"so we could write www.illinois.edu","width":194},{"text":"we could write www.bbc","width":120},{"text":"we could write we could say for example do ::1 if we wanted to connect to ourselves using IP6","width":544},{"text":"we could write 127.0.0.1","width":366},{"text":"if we wanted to connect to ourselves and we were using ip4","width":378},{"text":"for here, i'm going to now specify the port","width":146},{"text":"and you can do this with two ways you can literally just write a string","width":235},{"text":"like 1234","width":383},{"text":"but for well known ports like HTTP, HTTPs you can actually write the protocol name","width":575},{"text":"like HTTPS ","width":451},{"text":"if you happen to know the port number, yeah you could use that","width":416},{"text":"so get address info is surprisingly useful","width":166},{"text":"if you give it a ASCII name it will try to convert that to a port number","width":332},{"text":"for you","width":639},{"text":"so if it returns zero we've succeeded","width":357},{"text":"if it fails now we can actually find out why","width":226},{"text":"and that's where that function comes in ","width":267},{"text":"we could call gai_strerror and pass in that result code","width":725},{"text":"and that would give us back string","width":246},{"text":"okay now I'm not going to expect you to remember that, the string error","width":346},{"text":"but what you might do as a system programmer","width":251},{"text":"with this networking code and in fact any time you want to write good code","width":251},{"text":"is check the manpages","width":93},{"text":"so if we were to go to manpages","width":194},{"text":"is this going to work here we go","width":92},{"text":"alright","width":200},{"text":"we see that um okay i can take the return ","width":298},{"text":"if i now read the description and the return value of this it would tell me that hey this integer can be plugged into this call","width":461},{"text":"to give me a basic message about what went wrong","width":256},{"text":"and let's have a quick look down here to see the kind of things that can go wrong","width":338},{"text":"we have a bad family bad flags","width":253},{"text":"no data no name","width":136},{"text":"this call can fail in all sorts of ways","width":186},{"text":"we might fail at turning a name like bbc.com into an ip address","width":599},{"text":"okay but lets say it worked","width":214},{"text":"what do we do next","width":102},{"text":"well the first thing we might do is okay let's make a new socket","width":318},{"text":"now you seen in some of my earlier examples that i've made the socket at the very beginning of the code","width":243},{"text":"and i hardcoded in exactly what family and type of socket type I wanted","width":559},{"text":"but you could also just use the return values","width":256}]
