well you can construct examples where we might have a very long job","width":343},{"text":"and a whole sequence of small jobs and if you did that, the long job you want to put at the very end","width":576},{"text":"otherwise it holds up everybody else, it holds up all of the other processes waiting to run","width":508},{"text":"so how do we assure that the longest job is put at the very end? answer: shortest job first, yes!","width":571},{"text":"preemptive priority you would have to make sure the priorities are based on the length of the job which is not necessarily true","width":882},{"text":"the longest average response time, what's response time? well think about a webserver, a webserver might start giving you some packets, some results pretty early on","width":649},{"text":"but it might take several more milliseconds before you get the full response, we care about how early can we get the beginning, how long do we have to wait before we start to see some output? just the early output","width":1099},{"text":"right so what's the longest average response time? first come first serve could give us a long average response time","width":667},{"text":"because the very last job submitted is not going to give us a response until finally all of the other processes have completed","width":789},{"text":"if we wanted a fast response time, what we should do is give each process access to the CPU as early as possible","width":502},{"text":"so what's an example of doing that? round robin yes!","width":210},{"text":"so round robin with a nice short preemptive, nice short quanta so that each gets to do some meaningful amount of work and start generating output","width":749},{"text":"okay minimizes response time round robin, waiting time shortest job first, total response time so this is response time of course all processes again round robin would be useful here","width":1025},{"text":"how am i doing for time? right","width":310},{"text":"the other questions I will address on Friday","width":372},{"text":"I will mention I'll just finish with one important idea","width":479},{"text":"right psychological research has shown that if you want to learn stuff, if you want to remember stuff, the most important thing you can do is remember stuff","width":477},{"text":"what do we mean by that? is use your long term memory? how do i do that? easy start with a blank piece of paper, write down everything you know about every topic inside CS241","width":686},{"text":"tomorrow, come back to the same piece of paper and write down more, do not use your notes, just write down more","width":453},{"text":"if you vaguely remember something put some question marks and some helpful hints","width":217},{"text":"the third day, do the same again","width":210},{"text":"the fourth day give up and yeah use your notes","width":154},{"text":"but you will discover that in trying to remember things, in actually exercising your brain","width":349},{"text":"stuff we start to come out of it in drips and drabs at first but it will actually ensure that you have a long term understanding of this material","width":604},{"text":"and with that have a wonderful week I'll see you on Friday!","width":221}]
