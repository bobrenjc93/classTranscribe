If you put dining philosopher's solution, this is one of the pages you find","width":456},{"text":"But, let's see if you, today are more intelligent, no more can do more system programming than the interweb","width":461},{"text":"Because today we're gonna find out if this code is correct or not","width":320},{"text":"Right so let's see how it works","width":141},{"text":"Remember, this is gonna be run for each philosopher","width":201},{"text":"so the first thing we'll do is we'll take that pointer that was passed and we'll cast it so now we've got a pointer for each thread","width":439},{"text":"each thread has its own pointer to that little struct that we've set up, okay?","width":277},{"text":"And let's see what we do then... okay, so","width":341},{"text":"Our philosopher has two states, right","width":99},{"text":"They're either sleeping or eating.","width":235},{"text":"Well, that's not quite true because we also have this middle state where we're trying to eat","width":296},{"text":"Right but most of the time philosophers get paid to sleep","width":384},{"text":"a.k.a. think, right? so","width":82},{"text":"Between 1 and 8 seconds, our philosopher's not doing much, just sleeping","width":316},{"text":"but occasionally, they wake themselves up with a fantastic thought","width":222},{"text":"\"I am!
