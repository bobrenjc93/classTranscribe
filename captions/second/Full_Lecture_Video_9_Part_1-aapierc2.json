[{"text":"--------","width":64},{"text":"You'll notice that I forgot what year it is, so fix that.","width":138},{"text":"-------------","width":128},{"text":"Okay, so I want to jump back to last lecture where we were thinking about templates, right? We had this triple class, right, it had, it was a template with Class A, Class B, Class C, meaning it had three different template parameters, each of which names a type. So we can have triples of three different distinct types, or three unique types, or three types that are the same, or two types that are the same and one type that's not. Whatever, right?","width":1728},{"text":"---------","width":64},{"text":"So, the first one names the type of First, the second one names the type of Middle, the third one names the type of Last.","width":320},{"text":"And so we had a class that was kind of similar. Oh, I didn't realize that I'm cutting off a little.","width":256},{"text":"Okay, let me fix that","width":64},{"text":"I believe the way to do that is to just do one of these.","width":304},{"text":"----------------------","width":478},{"text":"That should say auto-adjusting and it doesn't.","width":169},{"text":"-----------","width":64},{"text":"Cool, alright. I guess I'll just move that over a little.","width":192},{"text":"------------------","width":90},{"text":"Call me out if I'm writing off the end. ","width":93},{"text":"----------","width":64},{"text":"I'll try and figure what the heck is going on there later.","width":128},{"text":"Okay, so we got our triple class, right? It's the same thing as last time and we wrote some functions that access things, but we're not going to worry about that. For now, I want you to think about this snippet over here. Right? So, I'm making a bunch of triples, I'm doing some assignments.","width":960},{"text":"So, I want you to think about each one that I've sort of drawn an arrow on.","width":192},{"text":"You know, is that okay? Does that compile? Or what does that do? Does that do what you would expect? Is that bad?","width":320},{"text":"So, I want you to think about that a little bit.","width":256},{"text":"------------","width":64},{"text":"Then, number two, so I'm going to give you some time to work on these; so then number two says write a template function make_triple(), that given three parameters, constructs a new triple and returns it by value.","width":768},{"text":"And then there is this sort of thought experiment which is why do we want something like that? Why is that nice?","width":328},{"text":"----------------","width":128},{"text":"And then three, so we're going to do one, two, and three, and I'll give you a little bit of time to work on those and then we'll come back after three.","width":404},{"text":"Three is write a call to your above function, so after you've written the make_triple() function, write a call to it that will make a triple with a double, an int, and a char.","width":640},{"text":"------------","width":2},{"text":"Okay, so a single character as the char, an int as in just a normal integer like one, and a double as in like 1.2 or something.","width":532},{"text":"And then, right next to it, write an invocation of a constructor directly that does the same thing.","width":512},{"text":"So this is, hopefully, three will answer the question of why is it nice to have a make_triple() function.","width":384},{"text":"-------------","width":105},{"text":"Talk to your neighbor for a little bit. I'll come back at, let's say, I don't know. I don't think it will actually take you all that much time. So let's say ten fifteen.
