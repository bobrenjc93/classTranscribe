[{"text":"All parts except for the last part can be handed in for the appropriate early submission deadline for extra credit. ","width":512},{"text":"I'll be putting in-- I did put in the extra credit deadlines on the course calendar. ","width":512},{"text":"So if it's a three-part MP, so you have mp_x.1, mp_x.2, mp_x.3, .1 and .2 can be handed in early by the early-credit deadlines, and you can get some extra credit on the assignment. ","width":704},{"text":"Those .1 and .2, those are part of the whole MP anyway, so you're going to do these regardless of whether you hand them in for the extra credit or not, so it's not extra work; it's actually just the assignment. The extra credit part comes in if you hand it in early, so this is encouraging you to start on the assignments as early as you possibly can, because that's beneficial to you. ","width":1536},{"text":"So start on them early whenever you can. The very first question I'll ask you if you come to me after like an exam, and you're like, \"Oh, man, my grade!\" I'll ask you if you've been doing the extra credit, because if you're not doing the extra credit, and you're worried about your grade, the answer is: do the extra credit. ","width":960},{"text":"You should be doing the extra credit because that will help sort of pad any sort of catastrophes that happen during the course. ","width":704},{"text":"Like I said, three exams and a final. The coverage for each one will be the lectures prior to that, so I'll try and tell you roughy where the cut-off points are as we're going through the lectures, but they're also here, and they're also on the course website. ","width":960},{"text":"Grades will actually be available on the chara gradebook, for which there's a link on the course website, so statistics like class average and histogram information are all there. You can also sort of drag things that have not been graded yet to see kind of what your final grade will be. So it's useful for answering the question, \"What do have to get on the final to get X in the class?\" ","width":1344},{"text":"Exams will generally be structured in two main parts: the first part is a short answer section, so these are short questions that you should be able to answer with like a phrase or maybe a little bit of a snippet of code, or write out what the output of a program was, or whether there was a compiler error, and if so, what? ","width":1472},{"text":"So, it's sort of short answer questions, and then the remainder of the exam will be reserved for in-depth coding questions or in-depth theory questions, so you may be asked to prove things, you may asked to finish implementing a data structure, you may be asked to implement an algorithm using a data structure and analyze its running time--all kinds of this kind of thing. ","width":1344},{"text":"There will be practice exams that I'll put up before the exams. ","width":448},{"text":"I don't do multiple choice. I do short answer instead of multiple choice, so on the practice exams they will be multiple choice, whereas I would just give you space to write your answer. ","width":768},{"text":"Prelectures and lectures are graded on completion, so if you complete the prelecture before the lecture, you get credit; if you complete the prelecture post-lecture, that's not a pre-lecture anymore, so you don't get credit. ","width":1408},{"text":"Do the worksheet as far as we get in the lecture, and you'll get credit for the lecture. Each one is weighted equally. ","width":704},{"text":"The worksheets I'll hand back during the lab section. On Tuesday, you'll get Thursday and Monday's, and then on Thursday you'll get Tuesday and Wednesday's. ","width":1216},{"text":"You'll be collecting two worksheets at every lab, basically. ","width":448},{"text":"Programming assignments: We'll be using the monad autograder, which was written specifically for this class. ","width":576},{"text":"Each lab assignment has equal weight within the lab group, and each MP has equal weight within the MP group, so if you look at sort of what percentage things are, everything is equal weight, so it's not like one MP is more important than the other MP; they're all equal. ","width":832},{"text":"There is no late policy for programming assignments, so if you miss the deadline, you miss the deadline. The reason for that is that we run this autograder nightly on the latest code you have submitted to subversion, so all the programming assignments and everything will be on subversion, so you hand in your assignment by committing them to subversion, and then, starting the night that the last extra credit is due, every single night that night and following, the MP will be graded using the real grading test script every night. You just won't see the output. ","width":2880},{"text":"You'll see whether you pass or fail the test, but you won't see why or what happened, or whatever. ","width":448},{"text":"That happens every night, which means that there's no policy for, \"Oh, I got a stupid zero,\" because you had like four tries to make sure it actually compiled, because it does grade it every single night. ","width":896},{"text":"There's no late submission policy because you had feedback every night up until the deadline, so make sure you're starting early and committing your code as often as you possibly can because you'll get feedback accordingly. ","width":960},{"text":"Just to pad, just to save you from potential consternation, so if you're sitting, let's say it's the night before it's due, and the last night that monad ran, it said I got an 85, I think I know what the problem is, but I'm worried that if I make that change, I might break everything and get a zero, right? So what do I do? \"I guess I'll just not do it and then I don't learn if that change would have fixed it or not.\" Make the change. Your score will be the higher of the second-to-last run and the last run of monad. So if you got an 85 on the second-to-last night, and then the last night you totally broke it and it didn't even compile and you got a zero, you'd still get an 85. ","width":3072},{"text":"Don't hesitate about making changes the night before it's due as long as it actually ran and compiled the night before. So this is again to reward you for starting early. Do you see any trend here? Make sure you're starting early. ","width":896},{"text":"Like I said, the extra credit for the .1 and .2, depending on whether it's a two-part or three-part MP, the not-last parts will both be available for extra credit. ","width":768},{"text":"If it's a three-part MP, the .1 and .2 are both half the extra credit total for that MP. If it's just a two-part, the .1 is all of the extra credit for that MP, so the extra credit is weighted that way. ","width":1152}]
