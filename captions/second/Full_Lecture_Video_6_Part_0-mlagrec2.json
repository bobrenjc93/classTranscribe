[{"text":"Okay, let's go ahead and get started.  Sorry for starting a little bit late.  I've had kind of one hell of a morning.","width":17706},{"text":"Okay.  So as far as announcements:  MP Memory was released yesterday, as I said it would be.","width":448},{"text":"So everything is sort of up on the class website, and in your SVN repositories, so you should be able to get started.","width":512},{"text":"This MP is rather difficult.  In the grand scheme of things, if I look and sort of look at the grade distribution for every MP, historically this the MP that covers this content has always been and always kind of will be kind of the harder ones, just because people are kind of struggling to get their head around C++ syntax at this point.","width":1088},{"text":"So please start on that as early as you possibly can.  It IS a partner MP, however my advice still stands: I think you should write your scoped pointer class yourself, so that you know what's going on there because that is going to become a device that we're going to be using for pretty much the rest of the class.","width":1024},{"text":"My DYB will be this Friday at 3.  Sort of in the basement lounge area of Siebel, by that whiteboard.  That is in office hours, it's pen and paper, so please come to that with any questions you've got about what like I've covered in lecture, or prelecture, or anything like that that's confusing.","width":1088},{"text":"Flora is having a redo of the C++ review session, cause I know there was some confusion about the start time for that, because she got stuck in traffic.","width":640},{"text":"The email everybody that RSVPed, but not everybody got the email, and I'm sorry.  So we're having another one that covers the same exact stuff, okay?  On Wednesday at 7:30, in 0222.","width":832},{"text":"If you want to go to that if you're like feeling \"Oh man, I don't know any of  this C++ stuff that's flying around\", go to that, that should help you out.","width":512},{"text":"Okay, as far as prelecture responses, I'm looking at it on a laptop so that tells you how prepared I am today.  I had like a printer that just decided to  bug out, and like not print half the worksheets, so we're lucky that we [gets  cut off].","width":896},{"text":"Alright, so that a lot of good questions here about R values and  sort of using std::move.  We'll talk about that kind of more in depth today. ","width":1216},{"text":"\"Partner with somebody, you both still submit the whole MP, right?\"  YES!  So  if you're working with somebody else on the MP, you still both need to submit  code for that.  Okay?  Just so that, it's easier from an auto grader  perspective.","width":1152},{"text":"Ya.  They're on the website.  Yes.   It's all on the website.  Go to the website.  Okay fine, I'll do it.  Sure, fine.","width":832},{"text":"Here we go, let's go to the course website and look that up.  So here we go,  on the MPs page we click MP memory and it's got all the deadlines right here. OKay?  So everything will always be on the course website.
