[{"text":"Okay so with the shortest job first","width":9064},{"text":"We're not interrupting the existing jobs","width":162},{"text":"So even though process 4 arrives and is ready to go","width":238},{"text":"And is 10 milliseconds","width":95},{"text":"We let jobs run to completion","width":229},{"text":"Alright so 4 before here has to wait an extra 10 milliseconds before it can run","width":422},{"text":"There is no preemption","width":194},{"text":"Okay that's what we're going to do down here","width":111},{"text":"When we do preemptive shortest job first","width":170},{"text":"When we actually take the CPU away from a process","width":369},{"text":"In the preemptive version yes we start with P2","width":260},{"text":"But then P4 arrives on the scene, the new kid on the block","width":249},{"text":"Alright and so P4, off you go","width":177},{"text":"P4 runs to completion and now P2 can be scheduled back","width":289},{"text":"It beats P3, it arrived earlier","width":482},{"text":"And then P3 runs","width":91},{"text":"And then finally P1 has been waiting all of this time and it gets to run","width":488},{"text":"Alright K","width":157},{"text":"First come first served","width":100},{"text":"Couldn't be easier, right","width":82},{"text":"It just simply write down the order in which we wrote them down here","width":212},{"text":"No brain power required whatsoever","width":112},{"text":"And then the last version we are going to look down here is preemptive priority","width":447},{"text":"Yep","width":508},{"text":"It's not about the remaining time ","width":113},{"text":"It's about the total time of the job","width":188},{"text":"It's not remaining shortest job","width":145},{"text":"It's about the total","width":320},{"text":"So don't do any subtraction stuff","width":161},{"text":"It's a common gotcha","width":404},{"text":"Alright so and the priority in this example saying a higher priority number is more important","width":380},{"text":"So process 4 is the highest priority but it's not around at the beginning of time","width":263},{"text":"Instead process 3 gets to run","width":117},{"text":"And then it gets interrupted","width":181},{"text":"Process 4 comes along and says I need the CPU and I need it more than you","width":251},{"text":"So process 4 finishes so we go back to process 3","width":276},{"text":"","width":2},{"text":"Process 3 finishes","width":63},{"text":"And then we go back to process 2","width":132},{"text":"Process 2 finishes","width":70},{"text":"And finally process 1","width":739},{"text":"So we could calculate some wait times","width":411},{"text":"This one is 160 over 40","width":336},{"text":"That gives us an average wait time of 40 milliseconds","width":473},{"text":"Shortest job first: the average wait time turns out to be 20 milliseconds","width":954},{"text":"First come first served: average wait time 37.5 ms","width":559},{"text":"Preemptive shortest job is 22.5 ms","width":966},{"text":"The last one is also 22.5 ms","width":732},{"text":"Alright so we don't care that much about the figures","width":194},{"text":"But what we do care about the following","width":254},{"text":"Firstly there is a difference in ordering","width":171},{"text":"And yes this was just a paper and pencil exercise","width":159},{"text":"But it kind of shows you depending on how much you care about a particular job","width":296},{"text":"You might be in the ready queue for a long time, you might be waiting for a long time","width":262},{"text":"Secondly we have a clear winner here","width":214},{"text":"The shortest job first minimizes the wait time in this example","width":487},{"text":"And uh in general as well","width":264},{"text":"And if you think about that, that kind of makes sense","width":183},{"text":"The long running job and I put that first, all of my other processes are going to have to wait for that length of time","width":472},{"text":"Therefore I should put the very longest job at the very end of my queue","width":327},{"text":"","width":2},{"text":"And I can just prove that recursively therefore that my average wait time must be minimal if I put my shortest jobs at the beginning of the queue","width":578},{"text":"And I order them by total execution time","width":275},{"text":"So if my idea of fairness, if my idea of an optimal system, was just in terms of how long my processes have to wait","width":537},{"text":"Then I would choose shortest job first","width":276},{"text":"There's a problem with that of course","width":140},{"text":"First of all we'd actually have to know how long our processes really do run for","width":334},{"text":"And that might call for a crystal ball","width":201},{"text":"Or at least an assumption about how my processes work today are exactly the same as how they worked yesterday","width":380},{"text":"And that's kind of stretching it about with real systems","width":559},{"text":"Our preemptive schedulers worked pretty well","width":187},{"text":"Of course they're more complicated","width":67},{"text":"We're going to have to write a kernel who is prepared to switch out a process and save it someway so that we can preempt and pull it out","width":522},{"text":"And replace it","width":257},{"text":"And our round robin actually has the worst wait time even though it was going to be pretty fair","width":576},{"text":"though we thought it was going to be*","width":64}]
