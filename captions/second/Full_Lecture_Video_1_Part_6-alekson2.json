[{"text":"Hopefully you were able to get to know some of the people in the class, maybe seek out some potential partners. So I'm curious, what programming languages have people used before? So I mentioned in the prelecture, I talked about Java, I talked about C, I talked about Ruby","width":5440},{"text":"Is there anything not in that list that people have not used before? Yeah. Matlab ok","width":384},{"text":"What are some of the properties of Matlab?","width":192},{"text":"Is it, sorry?","width":256},{"text":"Right right. So its good for engineering a lot. For doing calculations. Running simulations a lot. It tends to have pretty good performance for that sort of stuff.","width":1152},{"text":"Because it binds down to very low level. It's a very high level language, dynamically typed. But it binds down to low level cpu instructions for optimizing vector math and matrix math","width":640},{"text":"So its actually pretty fast","width":128},{"text":"Thats interesting thats a good one. yeah?","width":192},{"text":"Ok, good. So assembly language. Right, that's almost as close to the system as you can possibly get unless you really want to start writing opcoides and binary yourself which is awful","width":1152},{"text":"So you can actually please tell the compilers to dump the assembly to actually see the what the compiler is doing","width":704},{"text":"Compiler did with your program in terms of optimization, so you can exactly what kind of CPU instructions it actually runs","width":320},{"text":"So assembly is great for that sort ofg stuff","width":192},{"text":"Assembly is used a lot for embedded systems where you may not need to have a compiler which may target your platform so you have to write things directly in terms of what cpu insturctions do I want ","width":704},{"text":"To be running with what data with what registers","width":64},{"text":"Verilog","width":320},{"text":"So thats used in the architecture class","width":192},{"text":"For doing logic gates setup","width":320},{"text":"Or thinking about you may design a physical hardware for doing things","width":384},{"text":"That's an interesting language. I've never used it myself.","width":320},{"text":"But the domain is very interesting.","width":256},{"text":"Domain specific language","width":192},{"text":"Computer language that is used for specific task","width":192},{"text":"You're not gonna use verilog to manipulate images","width":256},{"text":"You are gonna use verilog to design hardware","width":256},{"text":"Its a lnauggae designed specifically for a small niche purpose","width":320},{"text":"And it is typically good at that purpose","width":128},{"text":"C++ Java Ruby, these languages are known as generic or general programming languages","width":256},{"text":"They are not specific to a particular domain","width":192},{"text":"They can be used wherever you want","width":128},{"text":"They may not be custom tailored with all opf the things that you'd like","width":320},{"text":"FORTAIN","width":448},{"text":"FORTRAN was really big, there's sitll a lot of FORTRAN code out there","width":576},{"text":"I hope nobody is writing any FORTRAN code out there","width":320},{"text":"I have not used FORTRAN on anything large","width":192},{"text":"But I have worked on a system which was helped refactor FORTRAN code in FORTRAN ","width":256},{"text":"FORTRAN is really nice though ebcause it is one of the first languages for lots of numeric languages","width":512},{"text":"Really really fast","width":128},{"text":"It was a very high level language","width":128},{"text":"So it was easier to express things in FORTRAN than in things either assembly or in C","width":448},{"text":"FORTRAN programs tend to be very very fast, even sometimes faster than C","width":384},{"text":"Thats sort of like a domain specific language for game programming","width":1024},{"text":"It'd probably take too long to figure out what the most esoteric major is","width":704},{"text":"I could probably look at the roster","width":128},{"text":"Not all CS ECE people in here","width":192},{"text":"Let's talk about all the material on the outline","width":192},{"text":"So in the lecture I talked and we sort about brought up the points about programming languages people have used before","width":576},{"text":"But I have mentioned that there are three main properties that I'm concerned with","width":320},{"text":"About the C++ programming language","width":128},{"text":"Static type","width":576},{"text":"Statically typed","width":576},{"text":"What does it mean for a language to be statically typed","width":384}]
