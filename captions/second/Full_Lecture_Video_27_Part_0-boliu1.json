So..","width":384},{"text":"You don't have to... it's not that you don't have to learn disjoint sets that you just don't have to worry them for tonight.","width":320},{"text":"Alright.","width":587},{"text":"So last time we were talking about sort of what graphs were and definitions on graphs.","width":384},{"text":"Most of these definitions will help us later on.","width":128},{"text":"While we were talking about algorithm on these and...","width":256},{"text":"you know, if I ask you to find an algorithm that finds a spaning tree, if you don't know what a spaning tree is ","width":256},{"text":"we can't really have that discussion. ","width":128},{"text":"can we?","width":64},{"text":"So this is sort of a necessary evil we feel bad about this but we have to do it.","width":256},{"text":"So, let's just power through these.","width":192},{"text":"Alright.","width":64},{"text":"So incident edges, does anybody remember the incident edges of vortex are","width":256},{"text":"For example, what are the incident edges of node E","width":512},{"text":"So there is a set of edges that gonna be like e, d","width":640},{"text":"e","width":64},{"text":"h","width":128},{"text":"e","width":128},{"text":"f","width":64},{"text":"Right.","width":64},{"text":"Is that all edges that are, what is this called incident on this vertex.","width":320},{"text":"that is to have one of their end point as this particular vertex.","width":192},{"text":"So, it's just","width":128},{"text":"this edge","width":64},{"text":"this edge and ","width":64},{"text":"this edge","width":64},{"text":"the incident edges of e","width":87},{"text":"Ok.","width":64},{"text":"And then we said that the degree of a vertex is is the size of its incident edge set","width":384},{"text":"in other words","width":64},{"text":"how many out-going edges does this particular vertex have","width":256},{"text":"tells me the degree of that ","width":64},{"text":"vertex. What is the degree of e?","width":128},{"text":"Yeah, the degree of e would be 3, cause there is 3 incident edges.","width":308},{"text":"Ok.","width":87},{"text":"Following from that what are called the adjacent vertices","width":384},{"text":"of a node","width":64},{"text":"which are the","width":64},{"text":"end point of those incident edges that are not the node itself","width":256},{"text":"Ok. So if I said what is the adjacency ...","width":192},{"text":"What are the adjacent vertices of e","width":256},{"text":"of this guy","width":64},{"text":"Well, I would say f, h, and d are the adjacent vertices cause they are the end point ","width":475},{"text":"of an incident h","width":110},{"text":"So, d..","width":268},{"text":"f, h","width":195},{"text":"Things that I can get to from e with one jump","width":192},{"text":"Alright. A path","width":320},{"text":"A path is just a sequence of connected vertices, when I say connected there...","width":384},{"text":"I mean that they are directly connected","width":128},{"text":"So...","width":106},{"text":"In another word you can think of this as a sequence of edges","width":320},{"text":"where you have a constrain at the end points of the edges that are next to each other","width":256},{"text":"that sequence have to be the same so it's like b, w, w, x, x, y","width":256},{"text":"It would be a path or something","width":139},{"text":"I am just gonna write down the vertices","width":69},{"text":"here.","width":64},{"text":"So you know a path could be something like you know go from h","width":256},{"text":"to","width":64},{"text":"i","width":64},{"text":"to","width":24},{"text":"j","width":64},{"text":"to","width":64},{"text":"k","width":46},{"text":"Ok. That's","width":47},{"text":"start here","width":64},{"text":"follow that edge and go to i","width":256},{"text":"follow that edge and then go to j","width":256},{"text":"follow that edge and then go to k","width":128},{"text":"Alright","width":64},{"text":"So it's just sequence of vertices are all kinda connected in that sequence. Alright.","width":256},{"text":"By one edge","width":128},{"text":"Ok.","width":64},{"text":"So there is a path","width":64},{"text":"Ok. And...","width":192},{"text":"A cycle is a path ","width":256},{"text":"where the star vertex and the end vertex are the same","width":256},{"text":"Ok.","width":64},{"text":"A simple cycle","width":128},{"text":"says that","width":67},{"text":"it's a cycle","width":64},{"text":"where there are no","width":128},{"text":"vertices that are repeated apart from the end point","width":192},{"text":"Ok. So a cycle could be you know","width":290},{"text":"f,e,h,g,f,e,h,g,f,e,h,g,f","width":384}]
