[{"text":"Oh it's it's... A lot of the same concept are still there, but the syntax may be slightly different than what you are used to if you have seen C++ before.","width":667},{"text":"Um, but don't be intimidated, it should just be fine. ","width":188},{"text":" Um, all of the core concept are still the same, it's just there are some niceties that we will take advantages of,","width":311},{"text":"and some extra features that we will exploit to make our data structure even faster in some cases.","width":268},{"text":"Okay.","width":142},{"text":"So meeting time is obviously now, every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and then you have the two lab sections.","width":548},{"text":"Um,  please make sure that you go to the correct lab section and also the correct room.","width":460},{"text":"We are pretty tight on rooms as you can see, so I really need everybody to go to the lab they are assigned to or you are not gonna be able to even sit down,","width":651},{"text":"to do the lab if you don't have a computer in front of you. Ummmm.","width":343},{"text":"Um, right so then the evaluation of the course in terms of exams there will be three exams and one final.","width":574},{"text":"I don't call them midterms,","width":66},{"text":"they don't really happen in the middle of the term.","width":189},{"text":"The idea here is not that I'm, you know, trying to, trying to be mean making you have exams all the time.","width":431},{"text":"I'm actually trying to help.","width":72},{"text":"Um.","width":43},{"text":"These exams, since there is more of them, it's weighted less in terms of total percentage points.","width":314},{"text":"So if you have a bad day on one of the exam days, its not quite as critical as it might be if I only have, say one midterm.","width":499},{"text":"Yeah, other flip side of this is that you get feed back earlier on than you might otherwise.","width":411},{"text":"So, by having more frequent examinations, you get to know earlier that you didn't understand something as opposed to like on the final when you just completely blank on something.","width":922},{"text":"Okay, um, right.","width":136},{"text":"The exams will probably be in 1404 and maybe this room too, um, from 7-9","width":509},{"text":"Typically they are on Wednesdays and out one every otherish week, except for this one.","width":522},{"text":"Final, I don't, when I wrote this syllabus they had not posted the final schedule so I can't tell you that yet.","width":436},{"text":"So it's somewhere after the class is done, sometime. That's all I know.","width":411},{"text":"Prereqs, so I expect everybody to have  two different kinds of prereqs.","width":278},{"text":"One is a prereq for programming, one is a prereq for theoretical mathematics.","width":291},{"text":"Um, so the programming prereq I expect is either CS125 or ECE 190. ","width":373},{"text":"Um, I know ECE is going under a curricular reform, I don't know if...","width":482},{"text":"Um, the coverage for ECE 190 was like C, um, so you should be familiar with programming in C, writing function in C, pointers, that sort of stuff,","width":791},{"text":"If you are coming ECE 190, your ECE background.","width":199},{"text":"If you are coming from a CS125 background, I expect you to know a little bit about object oriented programming.","width":325},{"text":"I expect you to know functions, iteration, recursion,um these sort of things.","width":481},{"text":"Okay, so the discrete math background is either through CS 173, which is the preferred prereq, or Math 213 which is also just fine.","width":669},{"text":"The main topics here would be sets, big O notation, running time analysis, induction.","width":514},{"text":"Very very heavily in induction, most of our proofs about running time will be using induction, so you should be very comfortable using induction.","width":656},{"text":"Lots of trees and graphs because these are things that, these are mathematical constructs but it's also nice to be able to express them in programming languages.","width":540},{"text":"So we will be talking about, about these sort of data structures as well.","width":316},{"text":"Homework zero is the very first assignment. ","width":176},{"text":"It's out right now.","width":59},{"text":"And the goal of Homework zero is to help you evaluate whether you have satisfied your discrete math prerequisite, okay.","width":340},{"text":"So if you look at homework zero and it looks like a bunch of random symbols and none of them makes any sense.","width":320},{"text":"You probably don't have the discrete math background that you need for this class, okay.","width":261},{"text":"Don't be load into thinking, into a sense of comfort, because the very first part of the class doesn't use discrete math quite so much.","width":495},{"text":"As soon as we start the data structure, all the math comes back all at once.","width":210},{"text":"So this first few two weeks, maybe, you might not see a whole lot of discrete math.","width":272},{"text":"And then the rest of the course you will see discrete math,","width":128},{"text":"pretty much the whole way.","width":61},{"text":"So, make sure you satisfy that prereq.","width":220},{"text":"And homework zero again is designed to help you understand whether.....","width":374},{"text":"to find if you are a little rusty, you know, you might need to pull out your textbook and review some stuff.","width":249},{"text":"But you should, you should at least recognize kind of what the question is asking,","width":257},{"text":"and and and have a rough idea that at least where to look to go about solving, okay?","width":352},{"text":"Alright, so as far as resourses, everyone should know where the course website is.","width":307},{"text":"I sent a mass mail I think only one person has added since then.","width":318},{"text":"Everything is sort of on the website.","width":158},{"text":"So there is a link to the moodle on the website, all the assignments will be posted on the website. ","width":250},{"text":"The calendars for all the office hours, exams, and the assignment due date, etc, is on there.","width":541},{"text":"So make sure you are checking the course website rather frequently to see there is any updates.","width":478},{"text":"The moodle, the only thing that moodle will be used for is the prelecture, so ignore everything else including moodle's gradebook.","width":701},{"text":"The moodle gradebook is not the gradebook, so if says you get a 98 on the prelecture it's lying to you.","width":403},{"text":"If you completed the prelecture you get, you get completion for the prelecture.","width":311},{"text":"If there not...","width":96},{"text":"All of the prelectures is just to expose you to the material, so if you finish the prelecture you should be getting credit for the prelecture. ","width":342},{"text":"But moodle is not...","width":78},{"text":"Don't look at the gradebook on moodle. Because we are not using the gradebook on moodle.","width":235},{"text":"Also using moodle so i'm not super happy about it, but it....","width":652},{"text":"Alright, we will get there, good question.","width":375},{"text":"Okay.","width":64},{"text":"So the um, I okay, I guess quick answer, the website, will have direction for every assignment.","width":664},{"text":"Specifically we will, we will get there. ","width":153},{"text":"Um, okay , so as far as discussion, again if there happens to be some undisables, you know,  forum on the moodle, don't use that, because I'm not looking, and neither is course staff.","width":663},{"text":"Piazza is what we're using for course discussion, so there is a link here on the syllabus you should be able to click, there is also a link on the course website, um so make sure you enroll in the piazza.","width":674},{"text":"The very first part of the homework is actually making sure that you've got a piazza account set up, so you should do that as soon as possible. ","width":517},{"text":"Let us know if you are having any issues getting enrolled, or you would like to use an anonymous email address other than your @ Illinois, which is perfectly fine.","width":680},{"text":"to..to have a non-Illinois affiliated email address on your piazza account, just let me know, and I can enroll you with whatever email.","width":926},{"text":"Um, so um, almost always posting on piazza is the right thing and emailing me is not.","width":530},{"text":"Emailing me, I might see it, if you post on the piazza course staff will see it and they will tell me about it if they can't answer, okay so. ","width":543},{"text":"Posting on the piazza that's almost, always more likely to get you an answer than emailing me directly.","width":403},{"text":"As said you can always email me directly, and I will do my best to make sure I get to it but I am juggling two different classes at the moment so umm.","width":448}]
