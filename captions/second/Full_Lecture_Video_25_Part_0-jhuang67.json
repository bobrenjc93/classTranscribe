[{"text":"Okay,while I write down the announce, woke on problems 1 through 4 in the work sheet.","width":4672},{"text":"It should all be review. So you should know the answer to all of them. I want you just sort of work on that while I write down the announcements.  ","width":512},{"text":"And then I will announce the announcement and then we will start. ","width":64},{"text":"[Writing announcement]","width":5952},{"text":"Okay. It didn't take me all that long.","width":3648},{"text":"Okay. So as far announcement, mosaic.2 is due 11pm. Make sure you are not using any of std::sort,std::partitions,std::n-element,std::stable-sort and friends.","width":960},{"text":"Okay.","width":64},{"text":"The goal of the constructor for the kd-tree is to have you actually write quick select.","width":256},{"text":"So if you are using any of these functions, you got an automatically zero for that part.","width":192},{"text":"So make sure your are actually writing the quick select itself. Okay?","width":384},{"text":"MP_GRAPH will come out today,probably little bit after the lecture.","width":256},{"text":"There is an exam on Wednesday. ","width":128},{"text":"From 7 to 9.","width":128},{"text":"I'm not hundred percent sure on the rooms yet. But I think they are exactly the same .","width":192},{"text":"I need to double check the reservation.","width":128},{"text":"As usual the lab on Tuesday will be review.","width":256},{"text":"And then a little bit differently, the lab on Thursday will have you working on mp _graph.","width":640},{"text":"So that the ... the lab on the following Tuesday will be review. ","width":448},{"text":"And we will not have lab on last Thursday because it's reading day.","width":192},{"text":"So we are wrapping up pretty fast here.","width":448},{"text":"Okay. So as far as the exam content is concerned the ...the focus on the exam will be on the dictionary ADT, because we talked about sort of two very dramatically different ways of solving that problem.","width":1152},{"text":"Implementing the ADT,so the most of the focus will be on that.","width":192},{"text":"We will wrap up sort of the coverage of what will be on the exam today.","width":320},{"text":"Sort of everything beyond page 1 of this worksheet will not be covered.","width":320},{"text":"But anything covered on the page 1 is certainly fair game.","width":64},{"text":"Okay.Let's jumping then.","width":256},{"text":"Does anybody remember what's the expected length of a list in a hash table using separate chaining as its collision resolution strategy was?","width":704},{"text":"N over M.","width":256},{"text":"Remember N is the number of key value pair .","width":384},{"text":"Actually currently in the table.","width":128},{"text":"And M is the number of cells in your table i.e the number of buckets.","width":448},{"text":"Okay?","width":64},{"text":"What was the expected number?
