[{"text":"Most of the time compiled and statically kind of go hand in hand","width":512},{"text":"But it is not always the case","width":128},{"text":"Question is which one is faster","width":448},{"text":"Answer is it depends","width":128},{"text":"Every interesting you can answer with \"It depends\"","width":256},{"text":"So most of the time if I can make a sweeping generalizations that make people angry ","width":384},{"text":"Statically typed compiled languages are gonna be faster than interpereted langauge","width":704},{"text":"Or a statcally typed language and apply optimizations on the entire program all at once","width":384},{"text":"It can move faster","width":128},{"text":"Instead of actually calling that function et me copy paste","width":384},{"text":"So I dont have to make another copy","width":192},{"text":"Recognize that this for loop may never execute","width":384},{"text":"So not write machine code for this for loop so just remove it","width":320},{"text":"These are all things that a compiler can do than an interpreter will have trouble with","width":384},{"text":"There is a middle ground called just in time compilation which is kind of like interpreting","width":512},{"text":"Except when you're seeing functions it's gonna compile the functions","width":64},{"text":"at once but not ahead of time but only when it is running that function or parts of the function or changing the instructions of the loop once it knows how that loop is executing","width":832},{"text":"Its a little bit fuzzy when you're getting into that kind of stuff","width":384},{"text":"Interpeted languages are typically faster","width":320},{"text":"What was the last property that I talked about for C++","width":640},{"text":"It's non-managed","width":320},{"text":"What does that mean","width":128},{"text":"Means for a language to be non managed","width":576},{"text":"So the non managed languages are not going to manage your resources for you","width":1088},{"text":"Resources could be trhings like memory or file descriptors or open file handles","width":384},{"text":"Things like sockets or connecting over the network connecting to another computer","width":448},{"text":"All these resources that the system have to provide to your pgoram","width":256},{"text":"Its gonna have a finite number ","width":192},{"text":"Obviously the limited memory","width":320},{"text":"Any resource tends to have a limited capacity and so its important that when its requiring is alos giving those resources back so it can be used by somebody else","width":832},{"text":"In a managed language","width":64},{"text":"Typically these languages have garbage collectors","width":256},{"text":"Resources when your program asks for a resource","width":320},{"text":"the program that's running the thread is going to detect when you no longer using your resource and is going to release it back to the system and you don't have to think about it","width":768},{"text":"A non managed language says that actually I know that you know better whn you're done with the resource so I'm going to let you do it","width":384},{"text":"And so you can just ask me for resources and tell me whrn you're done with resources and you'll have to do it manually","width":448},{"text":"When you forget, you leak a resource","width":256},{"text":"So there are many different kidns of resources that you might leak when you forget to release them back into the systmwe","width":704},{"text":"You have to be sure that you're releasing your resources appropriately","width":448},{"text":"Great for data structures","width":192},{"text":"Non managed languages are kind of dangerous","width":64},{"text":"Now you really have to think about when you're done with this data structure or part of this data structure or maybe this data is composed of memoory blocks all over the place","width":1088},{"text":"Deep understanding of what exactly is going on in the data structure so I kinda like using a non-managed language for teaching data structures cause it makes you really think about ownerships and semantics and when things are required and when things are released","width":1024},{"text":"Question was when you mean by dangers","width":768},{"text":"Suppose you have amemory leak","width":192},{"text":"What might happen","width":64},{"text":"If you ever use Firefox before it moved into double digit version number","width":384},{"text":"Firefox used to have a very nasty memory leak","width":256},{"text":"Over time if you had a Firefox open","width":192},{"text":"And you left it open on your desktop for like days","width":128},{"text":"And lots of tabs and you're opening and closing tabs over the course of the week","width":320},{"text":"You go to your system monitor and see that your Firefox is suddenly using 5 gigs of ram","width":448},{"text":"What in the world","width":64},{"text":"I only have 1 tab open","width":128},{"text":"Browsers are notrious for being memory hogs","width":192},{"text":"Its using more memory than it even makes sense","width":256},{"text":"Nothing that it is possibly doing","width":192},{"text":"Result of memory leak","width":64},{"text":"Requiring memory resources","width":128},{"text":"Forgetting to release it back to the system","width":256},{"text":"System thinks it using that memory","width":128},{"text":"And so its just gonna sit there ","width":384},{"text":"Memory leaks can lead to program crashes","width":256},{"text":"Some other program tries to allocate it will crash","width":320},{"text":"The ones that leaking it might not even crash","width":320},{"text":"Nasty thigns there","width":448},{"text":"Leaking file descriptors","width":64},{"text":"Manifestation cause you cant open files anymore","width":448},{"text":"Have fun trying to open a shell thats gonna require file handels","width":640},{"text":"Bad thigns can happen if you forget to release your descriptors","width":384},{"text":"All contingent on program still running","width":192},{"text":"If you have a program that leaks memory and close","width":256},{"text":"Then program is done and system knows that anything in that pgoram I can clean up now","width":384},{"text":"Not like I have to reboot but if you have part of windows leaking memory then you would have to reboot","width":576},{"text":"So memory leaks are quite a big deal especially in like server software","width":704},{"text":"If you leak too many file descriptors","width":192},{"text":"You cant handle any mroe connections","width":128},{"text":"Server runs for like 3 months and be like Oh I cant","width":320},{"text":"Website is down because it cant accept any more connections","width":320},{"text":"no symptom except cause it cant make any files","width":320}]
