","width":512},{"text":"Okay. As far as announcements go, lab inheritance grading, I fixed that, so there was a problem with all of it and everybody got a 255 out of 100 which is not at all correct because they got -1 and -1 becomes 255 apparently.","width":896},{"text":"-------","width":34},{"text":"So, that was user error on my part. I fixed that, so those are updated in both the gradebook as well as your svn. So you can go ahead and check that.","width":512},{"text":"Homework 0, I finally got around to actually uploading to the gradebook, so please check the gradebook to make sure that matches what you got on your homework. If it's not there, if it's not in the graded part of that visualization, there's this bar that's like here's your current score and then there's this all this other stuff like here's the future. If your homework 0 is still in the future part, that means it didn't get input, so either it never got graded or something else happened. So, if that is the case, if your homework 0 doesn't have a grade in there, or it doesn't match, please let your lab TA know.","width":1961},{"text":"And then we'll figure out, we'll probably grade based on the subversion copy assuming it was submitted on time.","width":384},{"text":"-------","width":64},{"text":"So, so, just double check that and make sure that's all in order, and if not, then bug your lab TA in lab.","width":320},{"text":"----------","width":64},{"text":"Lab this week, so, lab tomorrow is going to be for exam review. So, please go to that. I haven't asked the instructors for the labs to prepare anything. So go to that prepared to ask questions about stuff that you don't get or practice problems that you weren't sure of the answers on or whatever.","width":1216},{"text":"-----","width":64},{"text":"--------","width":8},{"text":"I aim for those to be more student-driven than instructor-driven, so it's not like they're going to have a worksheet ready for you to pound through. So please come to that prepared.","width":512},{"text":"------","width":64},{"text":"There was some consternation about lab debug because people were printing out stuff and printing out stuff is good except for when you do it like eleventy-bajillion times in a loop, and then it takes longer than a thousand milliseconds for your test case to run because you're printing out so much stuff.","width":1216},{"text":"------","width":64},{"text":"So, a lot of people who were doing that ended up getting 40s or 60s or whatever on lab debug because it timed out the autograder. Because the autograder sets a limited amount of time that you're allowed to run, and if you weren't printing anything, you should have been fine, but people printed out too much stuff.","width":960},{"text":"So I'm going to allow a late submission for that as of 11 PM tonight. So if you're one of those people who was printing out all of this stuff and you got a not-one-hundred on lab debug, you should be able to just go and easy commit. Remove the couts, and then I'll regrade it again tonight.","width":1088},{"text":"----------","width":128},{"text":"Because that's sort of not your fault. In the future, however, be careful. Make sure that you're not doing anything inside of your code that's going to slow it down when the autograder is running because there is a limited amount of time that your code gets to execute during the unit tests.","width":960},{"text":"------","width":9},{"text":"If you look at the output that you have if you're one of these people, you'll see timed-out. There's a timer that starts as soon as the code starts running and it runs for that long and if it's not done, it kills it and you get a zero on that particular test case.","width":832},{"text":"--------","width":64},{"text":"Make sure that you're not printing out eleventy-bajillion things in a loop or allocating a png of 1000 x 1000 every iteration of some loop somewhere. You need to make your code be efficient as well because these do have a limited amount of time to run.","width":1055},{"text":"-------","width":64},{"text":"Most of the time the provided test cases should take care of that. I'm surprised that they didn't here. So that's why I'm offering this regrade.","width":576},{"text":"In the future, I won't, so make sure that you're doing sane things in your code so that you're not slowing it down unnecessarily.","width":512},{"text":"-----------","width":128},{"text":"Exam 1 is Wednesday at seven. Again, there are practice exams and practice problems on the course website. There is a set of topics there that you should look at. I've also sort of tried to mention where I think particularly that those practice exams are deficient. So, things like copy-and-swap, move semantics, r-value references, these sort of things are kind of not covered on those practice exams, so it would be in your best interest to kind of go back and make sure you get those concepts.","width":2065},{"text":"-----------","width":182},{"text":"I still need to secure the rooms, so I'm sorry about that. I'm going to aim to no later than obviously in lecture tomorrow have those so I can tell you where to go. I'll also, of course, post those on the course website and the Piazza, so they'll be in like three different places, so you have no excuse not to know.","width":1088},{"text":"That will happen today at some point. By tomorrow in lecture, you should be able to know where you're going to be.","width":384},{"text":"-------------","width":128},{"text":"Mp memory.3 is due tomorrow at 11. So that's all of the parts, now. If you've done .1 and .2, .3 should be using your .1 and .2 to make your lives way easier than they would be otherwise. If you're just starting, good luck.","width":1152},{"text":"---------","width":64},{"text":"Mp list also releases tonight. So, at some point today, I'll have that ready and push that out. I assume that most people, based on the autograding report that I got last night, which said all of like 11 people were done, I'm guessing nobody's going to start on that just yet. ","width":1024},{"text":"--------","width":64},{"text":"That'll happen some point today. If you're one of those who's like super excited, it will be out. But probably studying for the exam is better use of your time at this point.","width":640},{"text":"----------","width":64},{"text":"But that will be out tonight. Okay, I think that's everything for announcements. Am I forgetting anything? ","width":448},{"text":"-------","width":64},{"text":"No? Okay.","width":64},{"text":"-----------","width":89},{"text":"Alright.","width":64},{"text":"------------","width":70},{"text":"Right, so let's jump right in.","width":128}]
