needs steady practice, which we are not getting, the labs are not specifically tailored to this.","width":320},{"text":"The Mps are gonna start happening and then they will be.","width":384},{"text":"The labs are gonna trail the lectures a bit.","width":320},{"text":"You have to have seen it in lecture and had to have digest it before I throw it at you in a lab.","width":320},{"text":"I'm gonna try and have the labs-The labs aren't gonna be \"The day I cover something you are gonna go to lab and do that\"","width":320},{"text":"I'm gonna cover something and then a couple days later you are gonna do it in the lab.","width":320},{"text":"The lab this week is going to be talking about memory.","width":256},{"text":"You are going to be doing heap allocations stacks, pointers to stuff, It's more memory stuff, its more last week.","width":576},{"text":"Its gonna have a little bit of a lag time.","width":192},{"text":"I get that there is a not a whole lot of practice for this but it is coming, so you don't have to worry about this too much.","width":384},{"text":"The Mps will be painful.","width":192},{"text":"The mps are asking a lot out of you and it is very quick because it is the summer semester.","width":448},{"text":"The mps are gonna be tough","width":192},{"text":"That's why I have the calendar packed as full as office hours as I possibly can.","width":768},{"text":"If you leverage your resources you should be ok.","width":128},{"text":"If you decide that \"I don't need any help and I got everything myself and I'm not gonna ask any questions and I'm not gonna have a partner and I'm just gonna do everything myself the hard way because I'm a badass\"","width":640},{"text":"That's gonna end poorly","width":192},{"text":"Don't try and be a hero","width":448},{"text":"So let's jump in","width":256},{"text":"I want to start where we left off last time.","width":640},{"text":"For two reasons ","width":64},{"text":"We were going really fast at the end so I want to make sure that that actually sunk in.","width":256},{"text":"2, I had a bug.","width":192},{"text":"So I want to fix that too","width":64},{"text":"I didn't read my header file carefully enough because we were going really fast.","width":320},{"text":"Let's reset and rethink this book class again","width":384},{"text":"So before we even do this one I'm going to talk about what all of that should tell me.","width":320},{"text":"I'm going to look at the private section of this header file because we are implementing the book class today","width":384},{"text":"We care about how it is actually implemented so we do actually want to look at this stuff","width":256},{"text":"So lets look at this, lets look at the comments","width":128},{"text":"Let's figure out what does this object look like","width":192},{"text":"if I have an initialized object of class book what should it look like","width":320},{"text":"Lets look at std::string** lines_","width":384},{"text":"and the comment tells me that lines_[i][j] gives us the jth line in the ith chapter","width":384},{"text":"What does that tell me about the structure of that line_?","width":320},{"text":"Remember that string ** lines_ could be 4 different things.","width":192},{"text":"Just reading that comment should tell me what that thing actually is","width":384},{"text":"It's a 2d structure, like a grid kind of thing","width":256},{"text":"Lines_[i] will give me an array of strings, and I can go to j and that tells me what the jth line in the ith chapter is","width":576},{"text":"when I'm saying a chapter I mean an array of strings, one for each line in the chapter","width":512},{"text":"A line is just gonna be a string","width":256},{"text":"If i want chapter five I would go to lines_[4]","width":512},{"text":"and if I wanted the first line of that chapter I would go lines_[4][0].","width":384},{"text":"Pictorially let's draw what this looks like","width":256},{"text":"If I've got an object lets call it B","width":256},{"text":"B is going to be a book object so its going to have a bunch of [?] in it","width":320},{"text":"The first one here is going to be our lines_","width":896},{"text":"Which is gonna be a 2D array structure","width":192},{"text":"So we are gonna have this point at the start of a block of memory which if gonna have some elements in it","width":1024},{"text":"What is the type of a cell in that array?","width":384},{"text":"string*, a string pointer","width":192},{"text":"The array the first thing that lines_ is an array of pointers to strings.","width":512},{"text":"And then inside of that array I'm treating that pointer as an array","width":256},{"text":"So that pointer points to the start of a block of memory again that has a certain length.","width":320},{"text":"The picture is going to look kinda like this","width":128},{"text":"Where each one of these is a pointer","width":320},{"text":"And its going to point to the start of a block of you know...","width":384},{"text":"You don't have to care about how the string is implemented here","width":256},{"text":"This is part of object oriented programming, you place your trust in the writer of the class that you are using, and you no longer have to care about exactly how it is implemented","width":576},{"text":"It's not c where you have to think, ok its a const char* and its got an end with a null terminator and I've got to be careful and not call [?] on something that doesn't have a null terminal and -nah","width":576},{"text":"Don't worry about how the string is implemented just believe that the string works.","width":320},{"text":"Then you just have to worry about the stuff that you are in charge of and the string class will handle that automatically by virtue of having properly defined constructors, copy constructors, assignment operators, destructors, etc.","width":832},{"text":"That's why we implement those things.","width":128},{"text":"So that other people can use our classes inside of their classes and not have to worry about things like this.","width":320},{"text":"Just believe that the string class is properly implemented and you dont have to worry about how it works.","width":320},{"text":"So I'm not even going to bother drawing in what the diagram for the string looks like","width":448},{"text":"This is an array of a bunch of strings","width":384},{"text":"This is going to be an array of a bunch of strings","width":576},{"text":"I can't have it be null","width":192},{"text":"There is no reason it couldn't be null","width":448},{"text":"Nothing about me treating a pointer as though it was an array would prevent me from setting one to null.","width":576},{"text":"Nothing special about that last slot either, it's not like I'm saying the end of an array is when you hit a null, it could be a null here","width":512}]
