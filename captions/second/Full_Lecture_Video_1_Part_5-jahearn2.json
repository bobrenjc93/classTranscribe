[{"text":"Exams--I've talked about exams a lot already, but basically the important point in this section is the regrade policy. ","width":576},{"text":"We will hand the exams back in lab sections that follow the exam period, so like not that Thursday, because it's not happening overnight, but like the Tuesday or Thursday of the following week, barring any catastrophes. ","width":1088},{"text":"When you get the exam back, it's your responsibility to go through it and make sure it was graded correctly, etc. and if you have a regrade request, you must submit it that day. If you leave the lab with your exam, that's your grade, period. ","width":896},{"text":"If you have a regrade request, it must be submitted in your lab section right after you get your exam, so get your exam, look it over, figure out if there's any problems with the grading, talk to TAs, make sure it's legitimate, and then if it is legitimate, submit it for a regrade request. ","width":896},{"text":"If you submit a regrade request, I will regrade the entire exam myself from scratch--all of it. The reason being, if there's a mistake in the grading, I was probably asleep while grading your question, and I may have screwed up on all the questions, so you might actually be getting more points back than just what you noticed. ","width":1088},{"text":"Similarly, I might have been asleep grading a problem and thought it was perfect and it really wasn't, so if there's a regrade request, I'm going to regrade the whole thing from scratch, under the assumption that I or whoever else was grading it fell asleep because they were grading too many of them, and after seeing the 190th exam, their brain was dead and they were no longer functioning. ","width":1216},{"text":"So I will regrade it from scratch, so that means it behooves you to make sure that what you're submitting is actually a legitimate regrade request, because if it's not, then you're just going to waste my time, and I'm going to be unhappy. ","width":1024},{"text":"I take exam regrades very, very seriously because it means that we've unfairly graded the exam, so I want to make sure that that's not the case, so I take them very seriously and regrade the entire thing. ","width":832},{"text":"All regrade decisions are final, so you can't be like, \"I want a regrade of my regrade, because I want a regrade of the regrade, yo dawg\"--not allowed.","width":896},{"text":"The grade distribution looks something like this, so 5% for prelectures and lectures, 10% for the labs, 13% for the homework and the MPs, each exam is worth 15%, and the final is worth 27%.","width":768},{"text":"Standard grade cut-offs will be used, so 90, 80, 70, 60, with standard plus and minus. Plus and minus is totally my discretion, so don't ask, because it can vary. ","width":960},{"text":"These cut-offs are guaranteed, but they may be lowered, so if the class is doing worse than I'd like, I may lower these cut-offs. Don't count on that. You can count on these, so you can know for darned sure of you got a 94, you're getting an A; if you got a 93, you're getting an A; if you got a 92, you're getting an A-; that's guaranteed. But I may lower them. ","width":1536},{"text":"So in effect, curve them. It won't be like, \"Oh, everybody did really well on this exam. I guess only if you got 100 do you actually get an A.\" I'm not going to do weird curving and trying to make things look like a bell curve if they're not a bell curve. No. ","width":1088},{"text":"I will lower cut-offs if necessary, but I will not make them more stringent than they are, so these are guaranteed. ","width":576},{"text":"All right, any last questions on the syllabus before we jump into the material?","width":512},{"text":"First MP is a three-part MP and I think is due... Look on the calendar. I'm trying to remember off the top of my head. I think it's two weeks from now. Okay. ","width":1664},{"text":"Is this visible in the back? Yes. ","width":832},{"text":"[Question about worksheets] I'll post them. You still need to be here to get credit for the worksheets, though. But I'll post them so that you can use them for reviewing and the exams and stuff. ","width":768},{"text":"So let's get started. Make sure you fill in your netid. ","width":576},{"text":"With your neighbors, work on the first four questions. So this is sort of how lectures will be set up: you'll come in, you'll have a worksheet, there will be some problems on it, I'll talk about it a little bit, and I'll let you work for a little bit, and then I'll bring everything back and we'll work through it. ","width":2112},{"text":"[Students are speaking among themselves, working out a few questions that are on the worksheet.]","width":6976}]
