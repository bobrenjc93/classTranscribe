The base is just going to be, probably the empty tree. Easiest one is the empty tree, in which case you don't have to print anything because there's no element to print in an empty tree.","width":942},{"text":"-----------------------","width":128},{"text":"If the tree is not empty then you have a choice as to what you do. My choice was to print first and then recurse on the left and then recurse on the right.","width":704},{"text":"---------------------","width":67},{"text":"Did anybody put their print function there?","width":256},{"text":"-------------","width":64},{"text":"How many put their print function in the middle?","width":128},{"text":"--------------","width":64},{"text":"Okay.","width":64},{"text":"--------------","width":9},{"text":"Did anybody put their print function there at the end , so recurse first and then print.","width":283},{"text":"How many people did that?","width":64},{"text":"A single person?","width":128},{"text":"----------------","width":128},{"text":"Nobody printed after the recursion?","width":85},{"text":"Okay.","width":64},{"text":"That's a valid thing to do, you could print after the recursion.
