MP_mosaic will release today that's the next MP.]","width":704},{"text":"Um, We have an exam coming up next week","width":256},{"text":"If you saw some commit activity to your subversion, some grade.txt with underscore rerun in them","width":576},{"text":"That was me being nice, so only a little bit nice. I added some code to the autograder to try and alleviate the issue where you declare a function but fail to define it.","width":960},{"text":"If you do that it's a linking failure and the compiler can't even link the testing executable and everybody was getting zeros if you had a function that you declared but didn't define and it was used in the unit test","width":768},{"text":"So like you had a copy constructor in your header file, you didn't have it in your cpp file and tried to call the copy constructor","width":384},{"text":"It compiles the unit tests fine because oh it's in the header file we'll be told where it lives later, then it goes to link and it fails link because it's never told where it lives and then it gets a zero and everybody's sad.","width":576},{"text":"I have done the autograder over the weekend to add support for partial linking so that in the event that that happens we only fail to compile the tests where we use that function we try and compile the rest of it.

Still deadline code, it's not like used your code as of when it ran. I used your code as of the deadline. The only point of rerunning it was because the autograder was sort of merciless when it couldn't link so I added some empathy to the autograder so it could link in the case where you have broken code","width":1280},{"text":"It already tries to give you credit when you have non-compiling code by only compiling the subset of tests that actually work. But it didn't do this same process for linking so I added that.","width":768},{"text":"Even some 6 years after being written it's till growing new limbs.","width":384},{"text":"If you have a meeting with me today I will be in 0226. The people who need to meet with me today know who they are.","width":576},{"text":"There is also a prelecture for tomorrow.","width":192},{"text":"There will be a big proof that we're gonna cover tomorrow so I want you to have done the prelecture before coming to lecture so you've at least seen that proof technique once.","width":704},{"text":"","width":128},{"text":"Any quick questions before I move on?","width":320}]
