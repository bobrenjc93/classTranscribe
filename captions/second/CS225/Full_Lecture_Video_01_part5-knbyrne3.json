[{"text":"Where's Tom? He's kind of unlikely to be in the stadium.Â ","width":256},{"text":"Darnit. Where's Tom Bogue? How are you going to find him in the stadium? How are you going to find him?","width":576},{"text":"You can raise your hand, and I'll talk to you. Yes, what's your idea to speak very loudly.","width":192},{"text":"Get on the loudspeaker. And ask him to meet you where you are right? Share your location with your iPhone right? Say come here right now.","width":896},{"text":"Okay, so get on the loudspeaker, so this is a technology that allows for simultaneous broadcast to everybody in the stadium. ","width":448},{"text":"Well guess what, what happens if the loudspeaker is broken? How are you going to find Tom Bogue?","width":192},{"text":"Can you yell loud enough from over there so I can hear you. Oh, call him or text him on his phone right? Yo Tom, meet me at the... Alright, so there's technology there that makes that possible, what's that? What is the detail that makes that possible? His cell number, that's right. So you have a unique identifier you can use to find him directly, not unlike a hash table I'd say.","width":2432},{"text":"Alright, now guess what, Tom doesn't have a phone. How are you going to find Tom Bogue? Oh, so you're going to trust that Tom has not scalped for his ticket, and that the official ticket sales office, has connected Tom to a particular seat yes? Yes, that's one way of maybe doing it. ","width":1664},{"text":"So there's some potential for fault in the system there. In an ideal world, that should work perfectly, good idea. Of course, you'd need to have access to that proprietary data, but you know, we're optimistic here. Okay, anything else? So we don't have access to the proprietary data, and Tom scalped his tickets. Yeah? ","width":1792},{"text":"I could go look for him. That would be my favorite thing. Okay so let's pretend you guys are the stadium and I'm going to look for him. Are you Tom Bogue? No, oh okay. Are you Tom Bogue? Are you Tom Bogue? You guys should stop me.","width":1472},{"text":"Are you Tom Bogue? Are you Tom Bogue? You guys should collectively stop this. Yeah, yeah okay. Why? Why? Why stop it?","width":640},{"text":"It's inefficient. That's right. You're sitting there going, \"She's an idiot.\" Right? That's dangerous to do, but okay. Yeah, because look, the amount of time it was going to take to go all the way through this room, and find out that Tom wasn't here, was proportional to the amount of time it took me to talk to each one of you. That's no good. Especially if we have a complete conversation right? So what else could we do in that scenario? Yeah?","width":2048},{"text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's like broadcasting right? Yeah? I could, oh, oh that's kind of cool, that broadens the bandwith of things. He said to ask individual people if they had seen him. So I could ask, that person right there if they'd seen him, and they would go, oh I didn't seem him. ","width":1792},{"text":"I could ask that person over there, and so instead of talking to every last person, I could maybe talk to every ten perhaps? Okay, fine. Yeah?","width":576},{"text":"Okay, very good, okay. Look at this. So, are you Tom Bogue? Okay, so what I would really appreciate is if you would everybody around you if they are Tom Bogue, and repeat this process with them. Okay? Alright, so do you have a mental image of what would happen if we did that?","width":1472},{"text":"What does it resemble? Don't tell me a tree, we're in a football stadium. It resembles.., you can get this, see this is why you guys need to go to a football game. It resembles a wave, that's right, we could do this. ","width":1280},{"text":"That's right, okay. So that kind of connects the story back and forth. And it turns out, it's not quite right, but it's close, it turns out that effectively we could examine the whole room in approximately the amount of time it would take me to talk to just a few people. You can imagine it spreading diagonally here. Now, the actual way that it would spread, well that's what we're gonna talk about later in the semester.","width":1920},{"text":"Actually quantifying the difference between the two algorithms or techniques for investigating the data, that's what this course is about. In fact, we're going to have arguments about which approach would be better. I might not trust that somebody else can ask the question. I might need to rely on this me asking every last person, that would be being a control freak. Alright, so in any case we're ","width":1920},{"text":"going to have those arguments and discussions. That's what this course is about. Any questions about it? Or comments? Alright, beat that one to death. Here's yet another metaphor. Here's yet another metaphor for what this class is about. And yet another question that helps me get to know you.","width":896},{"text":"Raise your hand if your closet looks more like the upper left.","width":320},{"text":"","width":64}]
