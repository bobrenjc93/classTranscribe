[{"text":"So there is a little location zero right?. I cannot say to you. I canno say to you. ","width":396},{"text":"So I am gonna take it around the ben. ","width":343},{"text":"So first in principle there is no location zero .","width":199},{"text":"You don't ever say what's your zeroth ","width":145},{"text":"favorite movie. ","width":51},{"text":"ok?","width":53},{"text":"So from the client side of things, there is no location 0. But from the implementation side of things ","width":462},{"text":"If it helps you. If it gives you peace to think of that as  location 0. Perfectly reasonable to do so . ","width":462},{"text":" That's a perfectly reasonable way of thinking about it. ","width":156},{"text":"Yes.[question asked]","width":128},{"text":"[asking questions ]","width":118},{"text":"Yes ","width":489},{"text":"Ummm.","width":183},{"text":"So location is passed in. ","width":113},{"text":"So remember that the parameter for find is the number of steps you walk forward . ","width":280},{"text":"Right? That is what it means. ","width":128},{"text":"It happens to be a function of the location asked for but it ","width":233},{"text":"right,yup,zero steps[answering question]","width":259},{"text":"ok.","width":42},{"text":"How we doing. Is it better. I felt really bad last time. It's like ahhh...","width":344},{"text":"And then I got 6 so it's like no no I am not gonna be able to make it better .","width":281},{"text":"Is it better. Oh, yeah.Ok. Thank you. You speak for the crowd. ","width":370},{"text":"Ok. ","width":64},{"text":"Alright, any other questions. ","width":148},{"text":"So, so this is kinda fun.This is kinda fun","width":240},{"text":"So here is waht I know about you guys . You guys are here after having taken an introductory class ","width":456},{"text":"which means you are in command of the basic structures, like iteractions and conditionals ","width":435},{"text":"And variables and arrays and functions ","width":141},{"text":"You are in commoned of those things ","width":138},{"text":"But it is unlikely that you have in your experience had  an opportunity to think creatively about ","width":398},{"text":"how you use memory ","width":128},{"text":"and so this is sort of the first opportunity  where you can kind of use memory to your advantage. ","width":482},{"text":"Now am I worried about this amount of memory that we used here? It is a little expansive how much do we pay?","width":371},{"text":"for this additional list node?The answer is no.  I am not worried about it at all. Ok ? ","width":320},{"text":"But it's a reasonable question. And [answering questions ]","width":800},{"text":"So,  this implementation the list has no tail pointer. This is a singly linked list .","width":470},{"text":"But if it's  a doubly linked list  you are gonna initialize the tail to point to the tail. In fact . ","width":438},{"text":"Alright,Let's have this conversation. Let's throw it down right now. ","width":299},{"text":"Alright,so what does an empty doubly linked list look like? ","width":231},{"text":"I think it looks like this, ","width":320},{"text":"Here is head. Here is tail. Umm...The next of head and the previous of ...oh I did this wrong ","width":579},{"text":"Ok?","width":76},{"text":"The next of head and previous of tail point to each other, ok ? ","width":299},{"text":"So I think that's an empty doubly linked list if you are using sentinels","width":320},{"text":"Ok","width":47},{"text":"Now, I really feel bad that mp3, every semester , every single semester. I say we should change mp3 to use sentinels and","width":544},{"text":"Course staff goes, no no no no. They should have to do this. ","width":320},{"text":"So I am on your side on this one. I never ever throw course staff under the bus but this time ....","width":704},{"text":"Yeah?[answering question ]","width":241},{"text":"So our implementation of the list class already doesn't use sentinels. ","width":326},{"text":"Ok? Our constructors don't create sentinels for you. ","width":225},{"text":"So I am sorry this one is not my fault. Just kidding, I am kidding ","width":336},{"text":"I don't even know we had that conversation recently .","width":192},{"text":"Hey  shaw we work on sth new?","width":64},{"text":"ok...","width":192},{"text":"I got another puzzle for you . ","width":320},{"text":"I have another puzzle for you. ","width":64},{"text":"Here is what I am gonna give you ok?","width":184},{"text":"We got some big linked list. We got some big linked list .","width":379},{"text":"Umm, that what's that little dot dot...you can use a a sentinel if you like in fact I think we need one. ","width":383},{"text":"Um, and I am going to point to the node that I want you to remove. So I am going to give you a ","width":586},{"text":"pointer explicitly to the node that i want you to remove. Ok? There it is. I want you to remove that node. ","width":512},{"text":"containing 7. ","width":128},{"text":"From this list ","width":192},{"text":"Ok?","width":234},{"text":"Remove the node containing 7 from this list now I am gonna let you vote. ","width":468},{"text":"Do you want a few minutes to struggle over the code yourself? ","width":269},{"text":"thereby kinda giving a you a testy sort of experience?","width":349},{"text":"Or do you want me talk over writing the code ","width":192},{"text":"Raise your hand if you want to. Umm... Do a little test review by wrting the code ","width":320},{"text":"Raise your hand high so I can see. ","width":169},{"text":"And raise you hand if you want me to talk aloud to do this?","width":287},{"text":"Alright. I am gonna give you guys a few minutes ","width":145},{"text":"To write this code. ","width":72},{"text":"And Then I will talk aloud. We are just never get through this semester. ","width":333},{"text":"Figure out this code. I think it is clear. ","width":221},{"text":"Ummm. You could call this guy head. ","width":256},{"text":"[ending]","width":640}]
