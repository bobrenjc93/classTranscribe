Okay.","width":256},{"text":"Who else giggled at the pbr?","width":320},{"text":"You got it too?","width":128},{"text":"Are you from nebraska?","width":128},{"text":"Pass by reference. Who's from nebraska?","width":448},{"text":"Do you get pbr?","width":128},{"text":"Okay. Nevermind.","width":64},{"text":"It's the beverage of choice.","width":320},{"text":"I don''t know why.","width":256},{"text":"Like, yeah you go home. I'm from there, that's why. it might be the beverage of choice here. I dont know. it's a fancy beer in nebraska.","width":1152},{"text":"Thats because its kind of close to this one, oh man we don't have time for this I'm so sorry.","width":576},{"text":"Its close to that.","width":192},{"text":"And if youre from nebraska, that has meaning.","width":192},{"text":"Go big red! Right? And its football season.","width":320},{"text":"Yeah, okay asdfasdf;nj abbbllaaaaahhh","width":320},{"text":"So why its the copy constructors parameter passed by reference? Why is it passed by reference?","width":512},{"text":"Exactly. Very good. So think about it. The alternative to pass by reference is pass by value.","width":960},{"text":"What happens when you pass by value? The copy constructor is invoked for you.","width":576},{"text":"But that's what we're defining here. So there is this sort of recursive definition problem that exists if we try to pass by value in this context.","width":768},{"text":"I encourage you all to go write your own little class and it can be simpler than this one. I dont even think you need any data members. Define your own copy constructor and see what happens if you try to pass by value. ","width":1216},{"text":"Uhhh alriight. So","width":192},{"text":"So why is the copy constructors pass by reference? Because the alternative. ","width":1024},{"text":"is pass by value, peanut butter value, and pass by value invokes the copy constructor. ","width":1216},{"text":"dot dot dot","width":128},{"text":"Which is what we're trying to define.","width":192},{"text":"","width":768},{"text":"Okay. So I encourage you to go test it out and see what happens when you try to set up a copy constructor pass by value","width":768},{"text":"Okay. another question is what does it mean that the copy constructors parameter is constant?","width":512},{"text":"So im asking you about the presence of that constant there?","width":256},{"text":"I think we talked about it very briefly. What does it mean in that context?","width":384},{"text":"The parameter, very good. So this promises","width":576},{"text":"that ","width":64},{"text":"the copy constructor and the function in general, so if this were a different function, its a promise that this fucntion will not change the parameter.","width":1152}]
