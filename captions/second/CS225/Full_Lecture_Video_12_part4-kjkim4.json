[{"text":"List item type. So LIT, list item type. You saw it as class T before","width":576},{"text":"All right. Any question about that?","width":128},{"text":"Okay. Yes? Why not? This is C++ we're speaking here. So, the C++ compiler will look at that struct and go \"oh I know what a struct is\". ","width":1088},{"text":"It's just a class where everything is public. It's exactly the same thing and you can put functions in there too. Guess what? You could even put a private section in there, if you wanted to.","width":640},{"text":"You could store data, you already do store data. You can put functions. It's exactly like a class. Why did I do struct? Exactly so that you would ask me that question. ","width":704},{"text":"Thank you. Okay Yes?","width":256},{"text":"Oh. You tell me. I'll tell you right now that this is a declaration. So what does it mean when you have a variable declaration? You got a type, you got a name, you might have a initialization parameter. It's just the name of my variable.","width":1216},{"text":"OK. So, you know, if I were drawing this out, here is \"nln\". It's not a keyword, it could've been frog.","width":448},{"text":"Which at this point, sounds sorta like a keyword. Any question about it? Yes?","width":512},{"text":"Yeah. Excuse me? No. No no no","width":704},{"text":"Except to keep in mind who you're communicating with. If people expect a class, you should use a class. If people expect a struct, you should use struct. OK? That's really it. Yes?","width":832},{"text":"Yeah. Yep. All right. Or at least mostly so that it is. I mean, maybe it's kinda convenient to not, if you're making things with everything public","width":960},{"text":"It's just... it's a class where everything's public.","width":192},{"text":"OK. Let's see. Here's what I want instead. I don't want this stack variable \"nln\" just sitting here. Instead, I want this. Write me the line of code that you could use to create this in memory.","width":1600},{"text":"So, instead, I've got a pointer. Do you want me to give you a name for this? Ok, call it \"yum\". I used \"yum\" a little this weekend so it's on my mind. ","width":1088},{"text":"Ok, anybody want to write it on my tablet? ","width":512},{"text":"You can. You wanna try? Oh, mine's terrible too. It's kind of a pain actually.","width":512},{"text":"Sure. It's fun, isn't it? He says it's intoxicating.","width":1536},{"text":"Good. Good. Anybody want to comment at all?","width":384},{"text":"Yeah. I would be explicit. Probably, the system would infer it. But, I would be explicit. So, I would've put a \"int\" right here. That's all","width":576},{"text":"Ok. All right. Any other questions about this? Good job. All right. Now, why did we do this? Why do we do this?","width":384},{"text":"We're going to admit that this thing holds on to future ones of these. And we're going to consider a unit to be the pointer together with the data in a sense. Together with this last box.","width":1344},{"text":"So, a unit in our structure is gonna be one of these things. And then notice that that's what we have hanging off here.","width":704},{"text":"It's a pointer to a box. So, if we do this. If we make this like this, then every list node is effectively the same","width":704},{"text":"Here it's kinda... you'd have a case where sometimes it's null and sometimes it points to everything else, something else, and so we're not going to do that.","width":640},{"text":"We're going to, for elegance sake, hold on to the first thing via a pointer. Now, here's what I want you to do next. I want you to change this in memory into this. So, write the line of code or two lines of code or whatever you need to make \"yum\" now instead point to this where this is what \"yum\" used to be.","width":2048},{"text":"That make sense? And you can work with the person sitting next to you to make it happen.","width":512}]
