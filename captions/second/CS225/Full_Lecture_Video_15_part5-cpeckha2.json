[{"text":"Does that lead to a question? I didn't make a slide for the constructor of this thing. Is that ok with you?","width":742},{"text":"So there's the constructor. Just set the top equal to null. Is that okay? It's probably okay.","width":442},{"text":"Alright fine we'll talk about it in a second. Alright so I wrote the code for pushing onto the stack. It creates a new node and fixes up pointers.","width":939},{"text":"What I would like for you to do is write the code for pop okay?","width":262},{"text":"go ahead and take a couple seconds given this setup go ahead and write the code for pop.","width":418},{"text":"And I'm asking you to kinda get into this consecrated mode just because it's good practice.","width":464},{"text":"Force yourself to write a little bit of code in this contexet cause after all this is much safer than the exam moment.","width":517},{"text":"You don't have to check for empty. You can assume that we're not goning to let the client pop an empty stack so you don't have to check for empty here.","width":823},{"text":"Okay, did you write the same thing I did?","width":3228},{"text":"Okay so what my plan was to grab hold of the top here, grab hold of the top via a temporary pointer, move the top down so that it points down to the next one, and then delete the first node.","width":1242},{"text":"Oh oh totally screwed up right. Do you see what I aww...","width":421},{"text":"No problem.","width":1568},{"text":"Okay I totally screwed up. Do you see what I screwed up? Yeah?","width":301},{"text":"Thats right I have to have a return value, not only that I need to grab that return value, so I better have a declaration. My very first line should be stack item type returnval.","width":1145},{"text":"= top's data right?","width":329},{"text":"Oh boy. Okay.","width":365},{"text":"I'm not going to make it that messy","width":230},{"text":"so stack item type returnval = top's data should go first, I'm sorry, and then return returnval.","width":779},{"text":"Okay a couple different ways of doing that the second you have a hold of it you can get it.","width":353},{"text":"Okay sorry about that.","width":120},{"text":"Any other questions about it?","width":134},{"text":"Okay yeah?","width":171},{"text":"You'll need to what?","width":492},{"text":"I did I updated the top, I moved it forward.","width":244},{"text":"Okay, alright so this is fairly simple, no problem here especially if you don't have to check to see if it's empty. Yes?","width":567},{"text":"Oh very good.","width":208},{"text":"Size minus minus. Okay good. Boy.","width":576}]
