We will see it in a minute and the example of that is pretty cool","width":768},{"text":"alright any questions about what you see here neglecting this blue box. the next thing we will talk about is this blue box","width":384},{"text":"so anything? yes  no you do have to use any kind of key words to overwrite it. You are already saying","width":1472},{"text":"keyword over writ.e no no I do not have to. this is straightforward simple. nothing else is necessary.okay?","width":704},{"text":"alright anything else about this? yes? right, yea we don't have to here. thats right thats right. okay. hmmm lets see. So lets talk about how we use this then","width":1088},{"text":"you can imagine,well, lets talk about how we use this. can we do this? can we declare flower? no we cant","width":576},{"text":"there shall be no more flowers,okay?and the reason for that is simply that a flower is not a complete class name.okay the flower is not a finished class. can we do this? sure of course right, this is , now we have all the functions we need","width":1088},{"text":"so this is fine,how about this one? can we do this? ok , we can still do this one. okay so that might be like a bit counterintuitive there.can","width":768},{"text":"have a flower but we cant have a flower pointer. and the reason for that is we already said the declaration like this is okay.","width":576},{"text":"fptr=new flower. that looks like i only have a default constructor there.","width":704},{"text":"okay? any question about it? yes?","width":576}]
