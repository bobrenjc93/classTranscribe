[{"text":"What would you like to have happen when we declare a sphere? Yeah? I dont have to.","width":640},{"text":"So the suggestion was a great one","width":192},{"text":"This is a moment where I get ot go oh, we love C++","width":256},{"text":"He said you have to allocate memory and I'm gonna go,","width":192},{"text":"its youre lucky day! Was that you? That said that? Its your lucky day!","width":256},{"text":"You do not have to explicitly allocate youre own memory. You can just declare one ok. Its fine, its there for you on the stack.","width":576},{"text":"Yes? Yes! It should have a default radius. Thats right","width":384},{"text":"Lets set up the default radius","width":256},{"text":"I'm giong to assert that a good one is the unit radius.","width":448},{"text":"Ok? Is that alright with you?","width":192},{"text":"Ok","width":64},{"text":"Alright, fine. Uhh, there is alternative syntax for this in C++ and the reason I'm telling you this is becuse you will see it. People use it. It isn't quite as clear, its's a little bit weird becuase it really teaches you something new about the language. Alright, here is an alternative syntax for declaring a default sphere. or a no argument sphere.","width":1984},{"text":"I'm either gonna do the first one or this one. I'm going to use what's called","width":384},{"text":"the initialization line to declare  the value of my member variable","width":768},{"text":"And thenm this is  an empty code block. Nothing to see here. Move one.","width":1216},{"text":"It does not have semicolon","width":512},{"text":"Its not a class definition. It as a implementation and thats the code block. The only place you have to have the semicolon is here or at the end of a line. That's a good point. Yeah?","width":832},{"text":"Yesh, no. Its like a parameter. Ok? So this is correct syntax","width":832},{"text":"What is there to observe about this syatax. There is a colon. It's the name of the private member as if it is a function. as if it is a function kind of and then you sort of pass the value that you want to that variable. OK? There is a really good question.","width":1408},{"text":"Yes. There you go, that's it. That's exactly what I wanted you to ask. Ok. Have I been doing this class a long time or what? What if you have more than one member variable that you want yo initialize. And the answer is the folliwong. if this thing also has a color associated with it, you delimit them by a comma.","width":2112},{"text":"which is also unusual in our context","width":256},{"text":"I dont know what r is","width":192},{"text":"Oh, and there is no semicolon. dont let me put a semicolon there, there is nothing there","width":448},{"text":"Ok. So I show you this contruct. For two reasons One is because you will see other people use it and two is because when we talk about inheritance in C++ this actiually becomes important there are cases where we explicity call member functions of super classes.","width":1408},{"text":"Alright, any qustions about this? Yes?","width":448}]
