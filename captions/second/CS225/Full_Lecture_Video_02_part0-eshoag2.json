[{"text":"Hello? There we go. Ok I had to turn it on.","width":2368},{"text":"So, RP is Reflections|Projections. It's like a conference where we have speakers come in and there's a job fair.","width":384},{"text":"And there's also something called Mechmania which is a coding competition from friday to sunday.","width":462},{"text":"And every year they make up an entirely new game that you kinda work your way through.","width":320},{"text":"Every year we have a Mockmania before the event where people try out the game and make sure there aren't any bugs","width":384},{"text":"Trying to get it ready for the actual thing. So if you're interested in being in Mockmania you should come and be a part of that.","width":704},{"text":"You can sign up at acm.uiuc.edu/mockmania","width":832},{"text":"And if you come there might be prizes if you find some really good bugs. And there might be food. There probably will be food.","width":832},{"text":"Yeah, Mechmania is the actual event and the Mockmania is just the trial. We'll probably have it in the next week or so.","width":576},{"text":"Ok. My turn. I didn't have bug free slides last time and probably the most critical piece of information","width":1792},{"text":"I have for you is just plain flat out wrong. I believe with 99% certainty that that is actually the course website.","width":640},{"text":"So everything you need should be there. I am aware that the lecture slides are not yet uploaded, they will be.","width":448},{"text":"That's like highest on my priority list to do after I get back to my office.","width":384},{"text":"It's a process.","width":128},{"text":"If you have general questions, even if they are one-to-one questions between you and course staff, please post to Piazza with those questions.","width":1088},{"text":"You can post privately. Right now all of our email boxes are way too full.","width":448},{"text":"And I think I have about a 50% hit rate on actually seeing all of the email that's coming to me.","width":576},{"text":"If you post to Piazza you have at least 40 sets of staff eyes on your message.","width":448},{"text":"I was asked a question right before class. Gosh I've already forgotten what it was.","width":384},{"text":"I suggested to be posted to Piazza so this is the perfect example. Does anybody have any questions?","width":640},{"text":"What is your question?","width":192},{"text":"If we're currently taking CS 173 will we get the math from that in time for use in this course?","width":768},{"text":"Ok, so I think that the consern came out of Homework zero.","width":384},{"text":"And sort of assess how much time we should spend on Homework zero.","width":384},{"text":"We've pretty much settled into the fact that 173 teaches you stuff in time for you to use it in this class. ","width":512},{"text":"There's like one day where it's kinda switched. One day when we're talking about induction it's kinda switched.","width":448},{"text":"But in the end it ends up being ok. So taking CS173 concurrently with this class is not bad.","width":512},{"text":"Now how much time should you spend on Homework zero if you're concurrently taking 173?","width":448},{"text":"I think Homework zero, at least parts of it, are kind of fun. And so use Google. Try to do it. Don't spend all week on it.","width":704},{"text":"If you kind of give your best effort and it doesn't flow but you are currently enrolled in 173 then you're ok.","width":640},{"text":"If you give your best effort and it doesn't flow, and you are not in 173 then you may consider adjusting your schedule for this semester.","width":768},{"text":"Does that make sense? Does that cover all the issues? Yes ok.","width":320},{"text":"Alright so more details for that discussion could happen on Piazza.","width":448},{"text":"I think lots of people are interested in that issue.","width":512}]
