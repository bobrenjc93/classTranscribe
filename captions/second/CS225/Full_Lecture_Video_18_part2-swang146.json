","width":320},{"text":" good. so he snuck in two, did you see that, the constructor,","width":448},{"text":" and then everything after this colon is used to initialize the members of the Animal class, I mean struct.","width":512},{"text":" OK?Any question about that? can I keep going? ","width":393},{"text":"no, I can't keep going, i can't keep going, are you kidding me?","width":320},{"text":" there's some new syntax here. Let me tell..","width":384},{"text":"(crying and laughing..)","width":256},{"text":" Sorry, well, this is, I'm like blushing, I'm sorry. ","width":960},{"text":"I did! I saw you running outta the building! ","width":640},{"text":"Oh they are having so much fun! OK, no more giggles, there shall be no more giggling, ok, for me. ","width":320},{"text":"Alright, take a look at the constructor for a second. ","width":631},{"text":"It's not just one constructor. ","width":192},{"text":"It's a whole bunch of different constructors because it allows you to give default values in the absence of specifications.","width":768},{"text":" So in the absence of specified parameters, this construct allows you to give default values. ","width":832},{"text":"Now, I do have a hard question for you related to this.","width":192},{"text":" And that is how many constructors is it? ","width":384},{"text":"six is one answer. four might be another answer. ","width":640},{"text":"Take a look. ","width":128},{"text":"eight might be another answer. one it's not one, I'll tell you right now it's not one, it's a whole bunch. ","width":512},{"text":"OK, so think about all the different choices here, think about all the different choices. ","width":640},{"text":"What you might think you can do, this is a reasonable thing to think","width":320},{"text":", you might think that inside each of these locations, you can either specify a name or not,","width":704},{"text":" specify a food or not, specify a big or not. ","width":576},{"text":"If that were the case, this would be like eight constructors, right? ","width":448},{"text":"This would be like eight constructors because it's 2 to the 3rd for the different options there, ","width":384},{"text":"but in fact, in fact it doesn't work that way.

","width":320},{"text":"Make sense? and you can leave off all three if you like, ","width":256},{"text":"but you can't just pick and choose, you can't say \"ok I'll specify the name and the size\" ","width":384},{"text":"you can't do that. OK?","width":256},{"text":" not even with clever use of commas. The fact of the matter is that the grammar that describes the language doesn't allow you to do this.","width":512},{"text":" Any question about that? That will become clear, I'll talk about that a little bit more as we actually declare some of these things. ","width":704},{"text":"OK, so that said, how many constructors is this? ","width":256},{"text":"four constructors, that's right. There's a no argument constructor. x","width":384},{"text":"What's the no argument initialize things to? ","width":320},{"text":"a big blob that eats, yes, big blob that eats you. ","width":320},{"text":"The default animal is a big blob that eats you, and that's you specify no parameters, ","width":384},{"text":"or you can specify, uh, wait.","width":256},{"text":"Or you can have one parameter, or two parameters, or three parameters. ","width":640},{"text":"Alright, let's see. OK, yes?","width":448},{"text":" that's right, you cannot just initialize the boolean value. ","width":384},{"text":"If you are gonna initialize one thing, if you are gonna pass one parameter to your constructor, ","width":320},{"text":"So, if you're gonna pass one value to the constructor, it's gonna be the name of the animal.","width":704},{"text":" OK? That make sense? If you're gonna pass two, it's gonna be the name and the food. ","width":320},{"text":"If you're gonna pass three it's gonna be all three. Yes?","width":64}]
