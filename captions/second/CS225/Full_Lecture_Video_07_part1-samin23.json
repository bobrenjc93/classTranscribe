","width":459},{"text":"I do not go very often because I have a job.","width":192},{"text":"Alright","width":64},{"text":"[pause]","width":128},{"text":"So we were talking about code and C++ behavior upon parameter passing and we has just concluded last time by mentioning that all the cognitive that we talked about parameter passing where also true about returning control from a function to the calling function ","width":1728},{"text":"So what we are talking about here is what happens so take a look at this client code, what happens when that call is made. Last time was all about the parameter passing and this this time its going to be after the function concludes what happens when you pass control back to the calling function.","width":1792},{"text":"Now there was some keywords that come about in the discussion of parameter passing that sort of described the different ways that were interesting.","width":576},{"text":"We can pass parameters and that was O those forget that this says return by and remember back to pass by.","width":768},{"text":"and the words are the same. So what were the different ways of passing parameters?","width":384},{"text":"Do you remember?","width":64},{"text":"Value. Good!","width":128},{"text":"Value","width":128},{"text":"Reference ","width":192},{"text":"and pointer by value. Now that whole discussion was kind of a bridge between passing by value and passing by reference because the behavior of the system and whats happening behind the scenes is the same as passing by reference but reference gives you simplicity and some cleaner ways of stating your intentions.","width":1856},{"text":"So this is a pointer by value","width":320},{"text":"Ok","width":128},{"text":"and you should kind of review the implications of each of those and syntax.. OK","width":640},{"text":"well like I said all the same things are true for parameter passing is return value and we are going to spend the first part of today discussing some issues there and kind of reminding our selves what those terms mean.","width":1088},{"text":"OK","width":64},{"text":"So here again we have a little class a student and we are going to do some similar things like we did last time.","width":576},{"text":"Here is some client that is code that uses a student and it makes a function call","width":448},{"text":"one thing that guess I never said but now is a good time to say it, is that in C and in C++ , you can write functions in the global scope","width":768},{"text":"That is functions do not have to be class memebers","width":384},{"text":"They do not have to be associated with the class.","width":128},{"text":"And suppose all of these examples have exploited that fact. ","width":320},{"text":"Ok","width":64},{"text":"So we are going to initialize a student C and we are going to set up a student C in the stack and declare a student pointer D. ","width":960},{"text":"So I am drawing the wrong picture for C.","width":192},{"text":"Look I learned something new.","width":192},{"text":"When I initialize a student C, it has some fields associated with it....[pause]","width":768},{"text":"Cat.and the Cat looks like that. and the cat has not been printed.

No so we cout the name and change this to true and then what are we returning?","width":1536}]
