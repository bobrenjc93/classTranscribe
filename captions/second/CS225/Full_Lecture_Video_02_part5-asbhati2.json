[{"text":"Okay so the comment is, the comment is, I believe, You'll have to comment me if I'm wrong","width":448},{"text":"That, that name matches this name. And that is absolutely germain. Its probably the most important point, because what I'm really doing here is creating the code that will make that declaration on the left work.","width":1088},{"text":"Okay? Its creating the code that will say what happens when that function is invoked.","width":320},{"text":"Okay fine. Im not too surprised about that. ","width":256},{"text":"Anything else here? Like look weird? Yes?","width":320},{"text":"Yes! Okay look at this wasn't here, look, you can look back. I didnt do that, when I declared this here","width":576},{"text":"okay?","width":64},{"text":"Sooo, thats different. Im gonna talk about it in a minute","width":384},{"text":"Okay, what else looks weird here? What else looks unfamiliar?","width":320},{"text":"Yeah?","width":128},{"text":"Yeah, what the heck is the double colon about?","width":384},{"text":"Okay, thats called a scope resolution operator","width":320},{"text":"And heres what that says, that says that this setRadius is the setRadius declared in the sphere class","width":1152},{"text":"its not the one declared in the circle class, its not the one declared in the, uh-oh what else has a radius, the arm class","width":576},{"text":"","width":64},{"text":"you get it? Doesnt your arm have a radius? Yes, okay!","width":320},{"text":"Ahhh","width":192},{"text":"Like if you ever broke an arm, you set the radius.Fine, tough crowd","width":384},{"text":"Okay, fine, so, this setRadius is the one assosciated with the sphere class. So if you saw one, if you saw something here that was attached via this scope resolution operator to another class, its not the one youre interested in. Okay!","width":960},{"text":"Umm, I'm not gonna talk about const yet, I'll talk about that in a minute. Uhh, suffice to say that the scope resolution operator attaches or associates a function  to a class","width":1024},{"text":"","width":128},{"text":"Alright, so lets set the Radius","width":192},{"text":"What code do you think we would have to do if somebody tells you, heres a new radius. How would I set the Radius to be that value? Yes?","width":832},{"text":"Very good!","width":128},{"text":"","width":384},{"text":"And thats it, thats the code. Yes?","width":256},{"text":"It can be, they can be. They can be but they are not inside the same code block. They are not inside the same code block. Now, so theres the they can be, but that makes you think, maybe they cant be too! Right?","width":1280},{"text":"Now, by Convention not because we have to, but by convention, we stick these implementations into a different file. Remind me to talk about that again before I advance the slide.","width":640},{"text":"Alright, umm, are you happy with that implementation? Yes?","width":448},{"text":"Yeah I might want to, because what this allows right now, what this allows is, uhhh, I could say, BBall dot setRadius ohh I'm not fast enough here, equals negative 4.7, right? And so this is our chance, this is our opportunity to do some error handling here","width":1536},{"text":"SO mayyyybee, I might want to say, if","width":320},{"text":"NewRad is greater than 0, do this, otherwise, theRadius- which should be a default radius?","width":1088},{"text":"","width":192},{"text":"Yeah?","width":64},{"text":"Yeah maybe 1","width":192},{"text":"Or just leave it? Dont make the change, but then youd want to tell somebody you're doing that. In any case this is not exactly how youd error, you'd handle errors. Alright so I wanna make a comment here.","width":704},{"text":"In this class, we are not going to talk alot about exception handling. Okay? We have too much to do, and so and were not technically, we're not a software engineering class. ","width":896},{"text":"So","width":64},{"text":"C++ has mechanisms for exception handling. You can google them, you'd be better at googling them after you go through these first four weeks of the course","width":576},{"text":"So, wait","width":192},{"text":"Let us handle exceptions in kind of a novice way for now and if you have questions about it later, we can discuss it. ","width":640},{"text":"Okay, uhhhh, what was I saying, ok yes","width":256}]
