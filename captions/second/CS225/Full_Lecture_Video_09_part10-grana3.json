Yeah that thing up there expects a sphere, right? And we're calling it with a ball","width":768},{"text":"Guess what? Whose copy constructor is invoked? is the question, right? It's passed by value, whose copy constructor is invoked?","width":832},{"text":"Sphere's copy constructor, that's right. And so that means, when that ball is sent to that function there is only a sphere inside of it","width":640},{"text":"But in this case, of course, that's fine, right? That's fine. There's a sphere, we needed a sphere","width":448},{"text":"So that's perfectly fine. Alright. So","width":128},{"text":"Sphere's copy constructor invoked even if it's the system provided one. Even if it's the one provided by the system and not our custom ","width":896},{"text":"One. Okay fine. Here's what I want to know next. I'm going to declare a base class thing and a derived class thing. Can I do that?","width":576},{"text":"[incoherent]","width":512},{"text":"Okay so this is - which one of these is larger?
