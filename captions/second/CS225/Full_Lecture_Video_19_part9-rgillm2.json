[{"text":"Yeah, so these are the, these are all the Mario games.","width":320},{"text":"I described this as the Mario family tree, but it isn't really that. Families aren't that big. But this is the set of games as of 2007, so I actually don't know what happened after 2007, but I'll bet you can tell me what this is.","width":1408},{"text":"You know what this is? Super Galaxy, I believe.","width":256},{"text":"Mario Galazy, sorry, I'm not actually as well-versed as I'm pretending to be here. I'm not as cool as that.","width":640},{"text":"But, here's why, here's why I love this tree.","width":384},{"text":"This is why I love. So first of all, raise your hand if in your household you have had one of the games on this chart.","width":512},{"text":"Okay, or you have played it, or yeah. So I'm thinking 90 percent.","width":448},{"text":"Tell me what this game is.","width":448},{"text":"All the way at the top.","width":192},{"text":"No you can't read it, it's Donkey Kong!","width":256},{"text":"And Donkey Kong, like, was, that's from my childhood, right? So this thing here connects us in a very unexpected way, right? Like it's one of very few things that, like, spans the ages and, so I love this because it connects me to you.","width":1472},{"text":"I also love it because Donkey Kong itself is the substance of a painfully fantastic movie called King of Kong.","width":768},{"text":"It got 8.4 user rating I think. I'm not sure, maybe only 8.2, but Fist Full of Quarters is the subtitle. King of Kong, it's a documentary about professional Donkey Kong players.","width":1088},{"text":"*laughing*","width":192},{"text":"And, and, I say it's painfully fantastic because we know people like this.","width":640},{"text":"*more laughing*","width":128},{"text":"We might even be, some of us probably, people like this. So, anyway that's my recommendation for Friday night. Maybe we should screen it in Siebel, I'm not sure. Or here! We could screen it here. I have to get permission.","width":1216},{"text":"Alright, anyway what I really want to know is, what I really want to know is, if you were making this into an application, into an application, an iPhone app or whatever. That is, if you were allowing for electronic navigation and manipulation, how would you configure memory so as to, how would you configure memory, that is what structures would you use? How would you do this so as to store all of these things?","width":2048},{"text":"What would you do?","width":128},{"text":"If this is a tree, it's probably worth figuring out where are the vertices and where are the edges. What are the vertices?","width":640},{"text":"The games themselves, right. And where are the edges?","width":448},{"text":"Yeah, so I think that instead of, you know, instead of these edges as they're actually drawn, maybe what is really going on here is like this. You know, that this is a substructure that would be meaningful to us.","width":1088},{"text":"Okay, so now what I'm asking you is what does a node look like? What does a node in this structure look like? What does a game look like? It's the same question, right? Games are nodes, what does it look like? What information does it have?","width":1216}]
