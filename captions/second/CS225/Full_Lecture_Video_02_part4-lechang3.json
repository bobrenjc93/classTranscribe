[{"text":"has shown us, that we have a function called setRadius that takes a parameter that's a double. Okay? Any question about that?","width":1094},{"text":"And now I can do things like, I can do things like \"cout\".","width":640},{"text":"\"cout<<bball.getDiameter()\"","width":576},{"text":"No parameters. And I'm gonna send an \"endl\".","width":575},{"text":"Now, new stuff! This is new!;)  Right here.","width":576},{"text":"This is like in C, printout. This is C++'s mechanism for allowing you to send output to standard out","width":704},{"text":"or send data to standard out. Okay? ","width":128},{"text":"And, there are some other little things you have to do. You have to tell.","width":832},{"text":"You have to state your intention to do so in your code,","width":256},{"text":"but we'll talk about that in more data later.","width":192},{"text":"So, you're gonna see this. All it means is \"hey print this stuff for me\".","width":256},{"text":"So what would happen if I invoke this command, compile the code and ran it?","width":512},{"text":"What would the results be here? This would result in ---","width":256},{"text":"twenty - two, gotcha! Yes you would get 22. Okay? If we implemented this.","width":576},{"text":"Okay! Now the kicker is here is what I can't do. Hold on just a second I wanna answer your question,","width":512},{"text":"but I wanna see if I can answer it without via esp okay?  Alright.","width":320},{"text":"Here's what I wanna know if I can do.","width":320},{"text":"Can I do this?","width":512},{"text":"Can I do that?","width":448},{"text":"Wow, really? Okay. So speculate to yourself a little bit.","width":640},{"text":"No, I can't do it.  Why? ","width":192},{"text":"Yes! This is what private means.","width":320},{"text":"Anything in this private sections is not accessible via the object itself.","width":640},{"text":"So this thing is not allowed.","width":256},{"text":"Because the radius is private","width":384},{"text":"Alright I have a little piece of vocabulary to give you and that is the following.","width":512},{"text":"This code in the blue box is called client code. Anything that uses a class definition is referred to as a client.","width":768},{"text":"It doesn't mean that you could expect payment or anything. It just means, \"users\".","width":384},{"text":"So this is sphere class client code.","width":704},{"text":"And so now I can say the sentence: private members are inaccessible to client code.","width":640},{"text":"Private members are inaccessible to client code.","width":256},{"text":"Clients cannot use anything declared in the private session.","width":384},{"text":"Similarly the reason I can use these two is because they're public.","width":448},{"text":"We've laid them out there, right? Like this is permission.","width":192},{"text":"This is not friends, or family, or U of I. This is everybody. Everybody can use this.","width":448},{"text":"Okay. Use these functions. Any questions about this?","width":320},{"text":"Yes?","width":192},{"text":"Yes, exactly. We're gonna talk about that in just a second.","width":320},{"text":"So his question was \"can we access the radius via functions?\".","width":128},{"text":"Of course we can cause we have a function that allows us.","width":192},{"text":"\"setRadius\", right? So we have to go through setRadius to change the radius.","width":320},{"text":"Alright. Yes","width":320},{"text":"You don't need a constructor to create the object.","width":192},{"text":"The system will provide one for you, but it's a really really stupid one.","width":256},{"text":"So you probably want to create your own. Okay?","width":256},{"text":"Alright. Anything else?","width":128},{"text":"Okay. Here we go.","width":128},{"text":"Alright. So I've sort of replicated what I did before, because I was lying to you of course.","width":512},{"text":"The code on the previous page actually won't do anything because we have not created the implementation of each of those member functions","width":576},{"text":"So that's what we're gonna do on this page.","width":188},{"text":"And so I replicated the code from the previous page here so I can talk about how we actually make those functions work. ","width":448},{"text":"But, even at this point, something should surprise you.","width":107},{"text":"So when you look at what I've replicated here, two things should surprise you about this code.","width":65},{"text":"What are they?","width":10},{"text":"What do you see here that shocks you?","width":208},{"text":"Shocks I mean. Yes?","width":448}]
