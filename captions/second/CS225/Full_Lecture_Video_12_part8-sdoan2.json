Any questions about it?","width":128},{"text":"You like it?","width":64},{"text":"Yeah?","width":64},{"text":"Do I? I was going to ask you that!","width":256},{"text":"He said do we need to pass by reference? What do you think?","width":448},{"text":"No, because we're not changing anything about this list.","width":256},{"text":"We're just sucking values off for printing.","width":128},{"text":"Okay? So we don't have to in this case.","width":128},{"text":"Alright fine.","width":128},{"text":"Uhhhhh...","width":64},{"text":"This comment is in the wrong place.","width":256},{"text":"Any questions about this code?","width":256},{"text":"Okay. Let's talk about the running time.","width":320},{"text":"Kay, now we can no longer say that there is no iteration and no exploration, right? Uh-oh, we got a problem.","width":768},{"text":"So let's look at this holistically. Well there is a couple of different ways of looking at it. ","width":192},{"text":"We will look at it holistically first","width":64},{"text":"So I'm going to parameterize the running time by... uhh...a function by n. Okay, so the running time is T(n)","width":768},{"text":"Function for the running time is T(n). Now I don't know how long this thing takes, but I do know","width":448},{"text":"that it takes time. But the amount of time it takes to print the rest of the list","width":384},{"text":"Plus some constant sum of time it takes to print a single node, the data from a single node, right?","width":576},{"text":"I also know that the time it takes a list of nodes of size 0, or the NULL case, is ","width":512},{"text":"some constant amount","width":52},{"text":"Kay?","width":64},{"text":"Alright","width":128},{"text":"So there is our first recurrence","width":200},{"text":"Ohhhhh","width":64},{"text":"Raise your hand if you did not take CS173 or a discrete, if you're doing this without the ","width":704},{"text":"discrete prerequisite.
