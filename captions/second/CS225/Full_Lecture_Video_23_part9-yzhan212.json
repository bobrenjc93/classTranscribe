[{"text":"And I'm gonna do this by reference also. That helps.","width":192},{"text":"Blank","width":128},{"text":"Okay?So that means we can actually change it","width":192},{"text":"So croot is equal to NULL. There is nothing there. OK, nothing there","width":256},{"text":"Croot is equal NULL. Don't look at the picture","width":192},{"text":"There is no picture","width":128},{"text":"Croot is equal to NULL. And I've got data I wanna insert. Where does it go? ","width":320},{"text":"Here! right? All I have to do is?","width":256},{"text":"Make a new node to put the data in","width":256},{"text":"So I can say if croot is equal to NULL, then croot is ","width":512},{"text":"new, good.","width":192},{"text":"New tree node and I gonna assume the right constructer exist cuz I don't wanna spend time on it","width":512},{"text":"Ok?","width":64},{"text":"Don't sneaker. That is. That's ok","width":320},{"text":"Ok?","width":192},{"text":"Alright","width":64},{"text":"Any question about that","width":64},{"text":"All right. Fine. What if","width":320},{"text":"croot's key so now so now we are in the case for croot is not equal to NULL. Now we are in the case for croot is not equal to NULL","width":512},{"text":"So what if you are looking for a key and you find it you have the value already in your tree","width":576},{"text":"What should you do","width":64},{"text":"So this is the matter of design","width":256},{"text":"Here we are going to do nothing","width":320},{"text":"here we are going to do nothing. we are going to let the tree take a unique value. What you might do is  changing the data associated with that key","width":512},{"text":"Em.. but for this example we gonna go a look. Key have to be unique  and that key is already there","width":384},{"text":"So we're gonna ignore this case.","width":192},{"text":"So I am gonna in fact write do nothing here","width":256},{"text":"And we're gonna talk about it in a second","width":192},{"text":"Okay?","width":128},{"text":"Otherwise, if the key is less than croot's key. What are we gonna to do","width":320},{"text":"Hum?","width":512},{"text":"I don't know what are we gonna to do","width":128},{"text":"But I do know that I should. Because we are not putting it in here. we are not, we are not putting the node in this current ","width":576},{"text":"Subtree. I don't know where it goes. But I know it goes in the current node's left subtree","width":512},{"text":"So if the key if less than the croot's key than we are going to insert ","width":384},{"text":"croot's left in I am sorry","width":320},{"text":"insert into croot's left key and data","width":320},{"text":"Otherwise, we are going to insert into croot's right","width":384},{"text":"key and data","width":320},{"text":"blank","width":512},{"text":"And you what I am gonna do. I am gonna go ahead and clarify this ","width":320},{"text":"So if key is greater than croot's key. So here clarify that case","width":576},{"text":"In comple","width":192},{"text":"get rid of this one","width":64},{"text":"Because we want to do nothing so we should just let the execuation proceeds","width":448},{"text":"Through this conditional never satisfy any of them. That's a good way to do nothing ","width":384},{"text":"ALL right any question about it?","width":128},{"text":"What's yeah?","width":128},{"text":"we are never gonna connect the node. The question is when are we gonna connect the node and I'm gonna say","width":448},{"text":"You already did","width":128},{"text":"Cause it is passed by reference","width":192},{"text":"Okay? So we are already operating on the node that is passed in ","width":320},{"text":"I take it from you that is time to go ","width":320},{"text":"I wanna know the running time first","width":128},{"text":"blank","width":128},{"text":"Big O h","width":64},{"text":"right","width":64},{"text":"good","width":64},{"text":"That's good enough for me","width":64},{"text":"Alright Bye","width":128},{"text":"Have a great weekend","width":64},{"text":"Class is ended","width":320}]
