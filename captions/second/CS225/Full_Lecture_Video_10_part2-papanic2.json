[{"text":"the problem is we can't instantiate all of the ball from the sphere's data","width":448},{"text":"We can't take this spere, it doesn't give us enough information to fill out this ball","width":320},{"text":"So the compiler will say hey, you are being to ambigious with me , i can not process this","width":448},{"text":"So this is the dissallowed","width":192},{"text":"Can't write there. You have to write it yourself ","width":640},{"text":"Somebody is going to ask me what did I learn this semester and my answer is going to be I learned how to use powerpoint","width":1088},{"text":"By the compiler ","width":320},{"text":"Now, Someone out there , someone out here, is wanting to ask can you cast that sphere to be a ball?","width":1216},{"text":"So that the types would match","width":192},{"text":"Five people were wondering if you could force that sphere to be a ball","width":832},{"text":"You could, but... anyone anybody who read your code would go ughhhhhhh","width":512},{"text":"It is a hacking way, an ineloquent and an insecure way of achieving type agreement.","width":768},{"text":"So, don't do it","width":320},{"text":"Unless you absolutely have no choice","width":256},{"text":"Don't do it because it is the easier thing to do, only do if thought carefully about all the other options, and you know it's not going to break things","width":768},{"text":"Oh i don't know, that means that the only thing you can ever assign to a ball is a sphere. is that what you wanted?","width":1344},{"text":"oh, then the parameter ,i don't know","width":320},{"text":"uhhhhh, so you know i don't claim to know everything , but if you are doing things that I don't know","width":576},{"text":"Then you at least better document it very well, and very carefully. Not only what you are doing but why you are doing it","width":576},{"text":"Right simple code. People like to read simple code, right. Simple code right, simple code","width":448},{"text":"Except in MP3, haha. ","width":320},{"text":"Alright, let's work, come on I'm sorry","width":448},{"text":"Oh i have a typo here. I left my old variable names here","width":448},{"text":"We need to keep moving","width":128},{"text":"Alright, this is now what i intended","width":256},{"text":"I intended s=b and b=s here","width":256},{"text":"Alright, so now though we are going to declare pointers instead. I want you tell me what you think happens","width":576},{"text":"I am going to declare a pointer s and b. And I'm going to instantiate   them with something.","width":576},{"text":"Instaniate a sphere with a sphere, but it will be a less stupid sphere. It will be a smart sphere. and ball is like a sphere but it also has a name associated with it","width":1280},{"text":"Now, Question is can I do this. Is this one okay, What's the consequence of doing this in the picture","width":896},{"text":"Means that s points like this","width":384},{"text":"that alright?","width":128},{"text":"yeah?","width":128}]
