[{"text":"welcome to the rest of the semester. How do you do that synta","width":256},{"text":"much like you do for functions you practiced.","width":256},{"text":"the class definition with templates and syntax. ","width":448},{"text":"and then, anywh","width":64},{"text":"and then, anywhere you see a T inside the class, it is replaced with what","width":576},{"text":"whatever you have","width":64},{"text":"ok? Alright, so let's look at this code in a little bit more detail.","width":384},{"text":"Actually I wanna pull out my list. I don't want wanna forget anything. it's been a while","width":256},{"text":"so","width":384},{"text":"my notes are fantastic.They tell me start with the blue code","width":320},{"text":"yeyyy ok","width":64},{"text":"I'm gonna start with the blue code","width":192},{"text":"so i'm declaring one of those things","width":192},{"text":"and the recognizing needs a type","width":256},{"text":"now you can tell from the name that it's a pair","width":192},{"text":"of integers","width":64},{"text":"the variable is .. so this is the variable name, the variable two names","width":448},{"text":"has type ezpair of integers","width":320},{"text":"what is this? what's going on here?","width":384},{"text":"im using a constructor","width":192},{"text":"right? So I should look up here and go oh yeyy. the ezpair class that a constructor","width":512},{"text":"that accepts theses two things","width":128},{"text":"now this point i think you can guess what that constructor does.","width":320},{"text":"its simply takes the two arguments and used them to extentiate the member variables","width":512},{"text":"right here","width":192},{"text":"this comes from there.. constructor","width":64},{"text":"any question about that? so far. I think you will have questions, but let's keep going","width":320},{"text":"alright, so now we also have declared getmax","width":448},{"text":"what does this version of getmax return?","width":256},{"text":"a T ","width":448},{"text":"this code doesn't know anything about Ts","width":192},{"text":"right? it doesn't know anything about T. so what does it return?","width":320},{"text":"an integer","width":64},{"text":"that right","width":128},{"text":"returns an integer. Ok, lets see","width":384},{"text":"so I wanna emphasize that point that this code want to instantiate the template","width":640},{"text":"you dont have to use that again","width":128},{"text":"You've already told the class that you want an pair of integers","width":320},{"text":"It is as if now.This is the name of the class., You dont have to keep reminding it","width":512},{"text":"we're talking about integers","width":128},{"text":"like, this is the name of the class","width":192},{"text":"if we have a ezpair a char, that would have been the type name.","width":320},{"text":"and if I had said getmax, and this was an ezpair of char, there would've been no ambiguity","width":384},{"text":"umm, so I the compiler, so you just said ezpair here, I believe that the compiler would infer","width":960},{"text":"what you meant. So you wouldn't have had to do this","width":192},{"text":"but actually when I read code, it helps me a lot to have that there","width":384},{"text":"so yes, it's optional for functionality,but it's important for maintainability","width":448},{"text":"alright, lets see. Lets talks about getmax","width":448},{"text":"so if you execute this code, what do you get?","width":64},{"text":"if you execute this code, what do you get?","width":256},{"text":"take a look at getmax. Ohhhh, getmax is funky","width":320},{"text":"what do you expected? If you couldn't see that code of there, what do you think you would get?","width":256},{"text":"a hundred, that's right","width":128},{"text":"now lets go look at the code. Alright, so getmax is implemented to return an integer","width":576},{"text":"right? or to return whatever the parameter is","width":320},{"text":"and uhh, it sets the value for return","width":192},{"text":"what is this?","width":64}]
