They're gonna throw your code away.","width":263},{"text":"","width":16},{"text":"So","width":10},{"text":"","width":21},{"text":"and that's like the biggest insult right?","width":111},{"text":"","width":45},{"text":"biggest insult possible, if you right code and give it to sombody else and they go AAH","width":248},{"text":"","width":61},{"text":"throw it away","width":38},{"text":"","width":70},{"text":"Alright","width":32},{"text":"","width":86},{"text":"Let me see if I was going to say something else here. Um...","width":198},{"text":"So I sort of implied this. I sort of implied this","width":360},{"text":"","width":207},{"text":"and","width":199},{"text":"we're gonna talke about it more on the next slide but","width":123},{"text":"","width":91},{"text":"The way these things are constructed goes in order from","width":291},{"text":"","width":10},{"text":"base","width":37},{"text":"","width":11},{"text":"through the derived classes so we can have lots of derived classes but they go in order from the base through the derived classes.

Okay.","width":158},{"text":"","width":39},{"text":"Ummmm... Let's do next slide. I love this slide. Love it.","width":360},{"text":"","width":89},{"text":"Always excited for this point in the semester yes?","width":172},{"text":"","width":267},{"text":"uh huh","width":18},{"text":"","width":256},{"text":"oh no, just the first one.","width":82},{"text":"","width":31},{"text":"just the...justs the...just the one above it","width":134},{"text":"","width":143},{"text":"Yep","width":12},{"text":"","width":87},{"text":"yes","width":20},{"text":"","width":111},{"text":"no","width":13},{"text":"","width":29},{"text":"no","width":18},{"text":"","width":30},{"text":"just calls balls because what's balls going to do?","width":148},{"text":"","width":76},{"text":"yeah","width":10},{"text":"","width":26},{"text":"right","width":23},{"text":"that's right","width":32},{"text":"so, his question was a good one and that is. is this like a makefile? It ...um if you have three, say a basketball. This example is a good one. If you have a basketball which is a derived class of a ball, does the constructor for a basketball have to call the sphere class constructor and the answer is no","width":1387},{"text":"The answers no. You could just call the ball class constructor which in turn will call the sphere class. kay?","width":404},{"text":"","width":59},{"text":"All right, I've given you some code here. Now this code is for illustrated purposes only. It's barebones a couple of class definitions and basically I want to know what the system does when I execute this. I want to know which constructors are called when and which destructors are called when. So the code is this, It's a base class pointer but I'm going to instantiate it with a derived class thing. So that's fine.","width":2416},{"text":"","width":66},{"text":"So ba...base class const...I'm sorry base class pointer instantiated with a derived class thing","width":546},{"text":"","width":122},{"text":"and then I want to clean up memory","width":185},{"text":"","width":82},{"text":"Kay I'm gonna clean up V","width":188},{"text":"The question is","width":163},{"text":"","width":70},{"text":"what's the output of.... what's the output of main? Go ahead and talk with the person sitting next to you and write down what you think the output of main is. And I'm gonna give you thirty seconds to do this","width":903},{"text":"","width":153},{"text":"Maybe 45","width":79},{"text":"","width":1920},{"text":"","width":64}]
