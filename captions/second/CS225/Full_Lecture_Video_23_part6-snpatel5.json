Satisfy the definition?","width":256},{"text":"Everything here is less then 37, Duh!","width":320},{"text":"Everything here is greater then 37, but clearly this is not a binary search tree, so whats missing here?","width":448},{"text":"Must be true recursively, so and T L and T R are binary search trees.","width":640},{"text":"Ok, so any question about it?","width":192},{"text":"Last time, uh-oh were in trouble because your flipping your page and were like, oh its perfect huh! Were unfinished today.","width":1664},{"text":"Ok, last time when we talked about binary trees, I actually gave you a slide that looked just like this, except there was no data in the tree node structure ok.","width":1088},{"text":"So I pretty much gave you this slide, but then right before we talked about implementation. But I didn't talk about it.","width":576},{"text":"The reason was because in a general binary tree, insert and remove  are ill-defined.","width":704},{"text":"We don't have a description for where our data can be for a general binary tree we can just put it anywhere we want.","width":640},{"text":"And when we go looking for it we have to employ a traversal so find as we saw at the previous part of the day was just traversal.","width":320},{"text":"So, but now, now the world changes because now if I give you a piece of data, say if I give you oh I don't know, 22.","width":960},{"text":"If I give you 22 and say, \"Where should I put this in the tree?\" you can go, you can start with the root and go well I don't know where 22 goes, but I do know that is has to go in 38's left subtree. ","width":1280},{"text":"And then we can do that again, ok so now, here's another tree the problem is the same I need to insert 22 into this tree and you go 22 can't go here because I already have a node here.","width":1024},{"text":"I don't know 22 goes, but is has to go in 13's right subtree, ok?","width":640},{"text":"Oh, there's no room there, so again, I don't know where 22 goes, but it has to go in 25's left subtree.","width":960},{"text":"And look we've got room for it! Its like goldielocks and the three bears, oh wait, no not quite like that, ","width":576},{"text":"There's nobody in my spot, I don't know. Wait. Thank you.","width":640},{"text":"So there's room, room in the end comes to mind. There's room there so we might as well put it there.","width":384},{"text":"Ok, Alright, any question about that, now look what we've just experienced.","width":448},{"text":"Well, we've experienced a prescription for where a piece of data goes.","width":512},{"text":"In a binary search tree, so you've got a given structure, and the new piece of data comes along, there's a algorithm its a well defined process for figuring out where that value goes, any question about it?","width":960},{"text":"Moreover, the same thing is true for say finding a value. I'm going to look for uh, well you tell me, what should we look for?","width":640},{"text":"Somebody raise their hand and give us all a number.","width":192},{"text":"What would be interesting? I've got a quiz for you. ","width":384},{"text":"Tell me something we should look for that would require three comparisons.","width":512},{"text":"Something we should look for that would require three comparisons.","width":320}]
