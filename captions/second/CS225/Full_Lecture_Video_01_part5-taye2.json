[{"text":"Where's Tom he's kind of unlikely to be in the stadium darn it. Where's Tom Bogue, how are you going to find him in this stadium, how are you going to find him. Raise your hand and I'll talk to you, yes what's your idea, you have to speak very loudly.  Get on the loud speaker and ask him to meet you where you are share your location with your iphone right, say come here right now okay so get on the loud speaker. So this is a technology that allows for simultaneous broadcast to everybody in the stadium.  Well guess what, what happens if the loud speaker is broken, how are you going to find Tom Bogue, loud speaker broken.  Yes so okay can you yell loud eneough from over there so that i can here you. Ohhh, call him or text him on his phone right? Yo Tom, meet me at the...alright so there's technology there that makes that possible what's that? What is the detail that makes that possible.  His cell number that's right.  So you have a unique identifier you can use to find him directly, not unlike a hash table i'd say.  Alright now, uhhh, guess what, Tom is a luhdike, he doesn't have a phone how are you going to find Tom Bogue, yes! Ohh, so you're gonna, you're gonna,  trust that the you're gonna trust that Tom has not scalped for his ticket and that the official ticket sales office has connected Tom to a particular seat, yes? Yeah that's one way of maybe doing it, there's some potential for fault in the system there. In an ideal world that should work perfectly.  Of course youll need to have access to that proprietary data, but you know we're optimistic here.  Okay, anything else? So we don't have access to the propiertary data and uhh, uhh, Tom scalpled his ticket, yeah?","width":8576},{"text":"I can go look for him, that would be my favorite thing.  So let's pretend that you guys are the stadium, you guys are the stadium.  And I'm gonna look for him, are you Tom Bogue? No, oh okay.  Are you Tom Bogue? Are you Tom Bogue? Are you Tom Bogue? You guys should stop me, are you Tom Bogue?  Are you Tom Bogue? You guys should collectively say stop this.  Why, why, why stop it? It's inefficient, that's right, you\"re just gonna sit there and she's an idiot, right? That's dangerous to do, okay.  Uhh, yeah because look.  The amount of time it was going to take to go over all the way through this room and find out Tom wasn't here was proportional to the amount of time it took me to talk to each one of you.  That's no good, especially if we have a complete conversation.  So what else can  we do in that scenario. yeah? yeahh, yeah, yeah, that's like broadcasting, yeah? I can, ohhh, oh that's kind of cool.  That broadens the bandwidth of things, he said ask individual people if they've seen him, so i can ask oh i wish this was a little bit lower.  I can ask that person right there if they've seen him and they would go i don't see him.  I can ask that person over there and so instead of talking to every last person I can maybe talk to every tenth perhaps.  Okay fine, yeah? Okay, very good, okay, look at this.  Are you Tom Bogue?  Okay so what i would appreciate is if you would ask everyone around you if they are Tom Bogue and repeat this process with them, okay?  Alright so do you have a mental image of what would happen if we did that? What does it resemble? Don't tell me a tree we're in a football stadium.  It resembles...You can get this, see this is why you guys need to go to a football game.  It resembles a wave, that's right. We can do this right? wooaahhh! That's right, okay. so that kind of connects the story back and forth, and it turns out, i mean it's not quite right but it's close.  It turns out that effectively we could examine the whole room in approximately the amount of time it would take me to talk to just a few people.  Going you know kinda, imagine it spreading diagonally here.  Now, the actual way it would spread well that's what we're going to talk about later in the semester.  Actually quantifying the difference between the two algorithms or techniques for investigating the data, that's what this course is about.  In fact, we're going to have arguments about which approach would be better.  Uhm, i might not trust that somebody else can ask the question. Uhm, i might need to rely on this me asking every last person.  That would be being a control freak.  Alright so but in any case, we're going to have those arguments in discussion, that's what this course is about.  Any questions about it, or comments? Alright, beat that one (inaudible). Here's yet another metaphor, yet another metaphor for what the class is about and yet another question that helps me get to know you.  Raise your hand if your closet looks more like the upper left.    ","width":14208}]
