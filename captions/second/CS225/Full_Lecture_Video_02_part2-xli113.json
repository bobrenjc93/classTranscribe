[{"text":"So, alright. We are going to keep sphere and denote it by its radius. What do we want to do with the spheres? So, once I have beach ball here, what do I need to be able to do with it? yeah? I might want to get the diameter from it. That's right. I might want to get information about it. I might want to get information about sphere. Anything else? I might want to do? yeah? I might want to change it. That's right. I might want to change information about it. I might want to change the radius. ugh, change it. OK? And, the last one is kinda implicit, and I already done it. We might want to create a new one. If you are coming from Java, this basically constitutes a collection of geters and seters right? We need to get information and change information. In C++, we do that ourselves explicitly. We don't just get ask for them. So, we are going to write the code to do it. Now, before we write the code to actually implement it, these things, we declare them. Now, here is the story, for the representation in practice, we are always going to put the declaration of the member variable, that's what those are, in the private section, cause we want to controll the access. Talk about that more in a second. So, in the private section of our class defination, I am going to write double theRadius. And now, I am going to use my functionality list, as essentially a checklist for the declarations of the functions I am going to implement. To declare the class defination. So, one two and three there are my checklist, and I am going to go through there, and start to declaring functions, achieve that functionality. OK? alright. So, the first thing I want to do is get information. If I am getting information from the thing, then I better have a return type. Better have a way to accepting the information. Ugh, what I am going to do is, oh, sorry, erasing, hmm. oh, no.. What I am going to do is, to have a function, with return type is double, whose name is get, probably one of these for radius,  diameter, volume and surface area. But the one I am going to use for an example is get diameter. There are no parameters to that function, and the declaration, ends with semicolon. And I will show you how to use that function that has no parameters in just a sec. Now, we are done with get information. Now, what does it look like when we want to chage one of these things? Well, we don't expect a return type, we might have a boolean in there to see weather we have been successful. The name of it might be setRadius(), and this time, we do want a parameter. We are going to pass setRadius, a double, whose name is newRadius. Hey, again, it is a declaration, and it ends with a semicolon.
