[{"text":"I'm gonna put a little question mark up there, we'll talk about it.","width":192},{"text":"Is k times the size of that block. It's k times the size of that block.","width":576},{"text":"Once for every-- so, you know , here's where k equals one, here's where k equals two, here's where k equals three, et cetera, we have n pieces of data.","width":832},{"text":"Now the qeustion is, how many of these-- how many times do we have to do this copying?","width":448},{"text":"Yeah, n divided by c and it turns out, minus one. So the top of this sum then is n over c and then there's this nasty minus one there because we're not counting what happens in the last case.","width":1024},{"text":"Alright, well I know how to deal with sums like this. c factors out, and then you've got k equals one to n over c minus one of k.","width":1024},{"text":"And that's just c times n over c times n over c minus one over two, and that's still big O of n squared over n pushes.","width":1152},{"text":"Okay. Last one.","width":704},{"text":"What else could we do?","width":320},{"text":"This time, well take a look at the picture. What's our scheme here? Double the array every time.","width":704},{"text":"And this is what I believe you were asked to implement in MP2, right?","width":320},{"text":"And this is why.","width":64},{"text":"I believe, was that right? In MP2 did you implement a doubling of the array? Really?","width":576},{"text":"Okay, nevermind, maybe I don't remember.","width":448},{"text":"Okay, so suppose the thing filled, and new data came along. Our scheme is to take however big it is now and double the size, okay?","width":768},{"text":"So here's copying and here's inserting a new one.","width":256},{"text":"If a new piece of data comes along, double the size, insert the new data and now we've got a freebie, right?","width":832},{"text":"New data can come along and no additional copying is invoked.","width":320},{"text":"And when you get to this level, it becomes significant.","width":384},{"text":"There's copying, but then look at how many free inserts you get.","width":448},{"text":"Now, we want to analyze this in much the same way as we did the previous example.","width":512},{"text":"That is, we want to look at the amount of copying per copying event and sum that up over all of the copying events, okay? ","width":768},{"text":"So, let's see. It looks like we're going to go from k equals zero to I don't know yet, we'll talk about it in a minute.","width":704},{"text":"How much copying do we do every time?","width":320},{"text":"How much copying do we do every time?","width":320},{"text":"Somebody raise their hand and tell me the expression. Yeah? Yeah, good. Uh oh.","width":1024},{"text":"What a mess. Okay. So, it's--","width":960},{"text":"Two to the k, good.","width":448},{"text":"And how many of them do we have?","width":192},{"text":"How many of these things do we have?","width":192}]
