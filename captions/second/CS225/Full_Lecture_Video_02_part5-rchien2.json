[{"text":"Ok, so the comment is, I believe you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong that that name matches this name, and that is absolutely germane.","width":768},{"text":"It's probably the most important point because what I'm really doing here is creating the code that will make that declaration on the left work.","width":768},{"text":"It's creating the code that will say what happens when that function is invoked. OK, fine, I'm not too surprised about that. Anything else here?","width":704},{"text":"Like look weird? Yes? Yes, okay look at this wasn't here. You can look back. I didn't do that when I declared that here. So, that's different.","width":1024},{"text":"I'm about to talk about it in a minute.","width":64},{"text":"What else looks weird here. What else looks unfamiliar?","width":448},{"text":"Yeah?","width":64},{"text":"Yeah what the heck is the double colon about","width":192},{"text":"Ok, that's called a scope resolution operator.","width":512},{"text":"And here's what that says.","width":512},{"text":"That says that this setRadius is the setRadius declared in the sphere class","width":640},{"text":"It's not the one declared in the circle class. It's not the one declared in the, uh oh, what else has a radius?","width":448},{"text":"The arm class. You get it. Doesn't your arm have a radius. Yes, okay.","width":512},{"text":"That could be a broken arm, you set the radius right? Fine. tough crowd.","width":704},{"text":"Ok fine, this set radius is the one associated with the sphere class, so if you saw something here that was attached via this scope resolution operator to another class, it's not the one you're interested in.","width":768},{"text":"Ok, I'm not going to talk about const yet; I'll talk about that in a minute.","width":320},{"text":"So, suffice to say that the scope resolution operator attaches or associates a function to a class.","width":768},{"text":"Alright, so let's set the radius.","width":320},{"text":"What code do you think we would have to do if somebody tells you here's a new radius. How would I set the radius to be that value? Yes?","width":768},{"text":"Very good.","width":256},{"text":"That's it, that's the code. Yes?","width":512},{"text":"They can be. They can be. They can be, but they are not inside the same block. Now, so they can be, they can be but they are not inside the same code block.","width":832},{"text":"But that makes you think, now they can't be right?","width":512},{"text":"Now, by convention, not because we have to, but by convention we state these implementations into a different pile.","width":448},{"text":"Remind me to talk about that again before I bounce a slide ok.","width":192},{"text":"Alright, are you happy with that implementation?","width":256},{"text":"Yes?","width":128},{"text":"Yeah, I might want to because what this allows right now was this allows is, I could say, bball.setradius = negative 4.7.","width":1152},{"text":"And so this is our chance, our opportunity to do some error handling here.","width":512},{"text":"So maybe I might want to say, if newrad is greater than zero, do this","width":704},{"text":"Otherwise, the radius which should be a default radius","width":448},{"text":"Yeah?","width":448},{"text":"Yeah maybe 1","width":128},{"text":"Or leave it. Don't make a change, but then you want to tell somebody that you were doing that.","width":384},{"text":"In any case, this is not exactly how you handle errors.","width":256},{"text":"Alright, so I want to make a comment here.","width":64},{"text":"In this class, we are not going to talk a lot about exception handling.","width":512},{"text":"We have too much to do and so we're not a software engineering class.","width":448},{"text":"So, C++ has mechanisms for exception handling.","width":256},{"text":"You can google them, you'll be better at googling them after you go through these first 4 weeks of the course.","width":448},{"text":"So, wait, let us handle exceptions in kind of a novice way for now and if you have questions about it later, we can discuss it. Ok what was I supposed to..","width":896}]
