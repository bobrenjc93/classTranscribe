And just.","width":640},{"text":"Oh, hey, that didn't work.","width":192},{"text":"Say, I don't think dereferencing Y is a good idea.","width":320},{"text":"Cause you know that setting up the pointee is a separate step.","width":192},{"text":"And I don't we ever did it.","width":192},{"text":"Good point.","width":64},{"text":"Yeh, we allocate the pointer Y, but we never set it point to a pointee.","width":384},{"text":"Em, very observant. ","width":128},{"text":"Can you fix it to the y point to the same pointee as x.","width":256},{"text":"Sure, I will use my magic pointer assignment.","width":192},{"text":"Is that gonna be a problem as before.

Because the pointer are sharing that one pointee.","width":384},{"text":"So are we gonna switch the places now. ","width":512},{"text":"The three pointer rules.","width":128},{"text":"Number one.","width":64},{"text":"The basic structure is you use a pointer and it points over a pointee.","width":320},{"text":"But the pointer and pointee are separate.","width":64},{"text":"The common error is to set up a pointer, but forget to give it a pointee.","width":320},{"text":"Number two, pointer dereferencing the pointer, and follow its arrow have access to a pointee.","width":384},{"text":"This only works when there is a pointee.
