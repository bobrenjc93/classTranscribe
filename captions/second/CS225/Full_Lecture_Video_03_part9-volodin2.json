[{"text":"Any questions about that? Okay that's just vocabulary. So the same two things. Listen just a minute and do another sort of high level view. So, these circles represent code for a class definition, consider a single class at this point, we've already said that we separate into a header file and implementation file. So the example is sphere.cpp and sphere.h and the vocabulary we use for that .h is interface because I can give you a .h file and you know how to use the class, you don't need the .cpp to get everything you need from the .h file. Now what are all these little blue bubbles? That one is my neighbor Virginia. Here is the main that I happen to use. Maddox came to my office, said hey you got a sphere I can use? I said sure, here's the idea. HEre's what encapsulation gets for you. It allows you to make it so that all these clients can do their business looking only at the interface and it can build a wall , demands that a wall is build between the clients and the implementation. The client can see everything they need to know about the interface and don't need to worry about the implementation. Any questions? It streamlines the communication about these classes at exactly the right level of abstraction. The substance of today is actually memory. If you came from CS125, most of what we've done is pretty much familiar. But it's probably very new if you came from the CE engineering prereq. If you came from the ECE department, you have a pretty good handle on memory. We do talk about this stuff and should be comfortable for CS majors and ECE majors but DO NOT click out because there will be a few things about the wa C++ refers to memory that will surprise you even if you have seen it.
