[{"text":"So I did something this weekend. ","width":120},{"text":"I've never done it before, and its incredibly empowering.","width":327},{"text":"I signed up for an amazon EC2 instance and installed my own web server, and got my website running on it all by myself.","width":734},{"text":"Up until this weekend I had no idea what a web configuration file was or a server configuration file.","width":470},{"text":"I didn't know what httpd meant.","width":197},{"text":"And I just feel like I'm a bigger person today because of it.","width":419},{"text":"It is really empowering.","width":94},{"text":"This thing that we do, its a blast!","width":278},{"text":"Alight, I thought I would share that with you.","width":293},{"text":"Its one of those intimate moments between friends.","width":239},{"text":"Okay, so lets talk about templates.","width":331},{"text":"Why did that occur to me because we are leaving behind the C++ portion of the course and moving more into the abstract data structures.","width":695},{"text":"A little more mathematical portion of the course.","width":117},{"text":"So I was waxing about the fact that I like to program and I am going to miss it.","width":415},{"text":"But, here we go anyway","width":86},{"text":"Alright, so the couple of little things you notice about this immediately. You might have wondered about last time or we might have talked about it but I can't remember.","width":543},{"text":"Its  okay to pass more than one type.","width":288},{"text":"More than one type as a type parameter to a function or to a class.","width":261},{"text":"So what you see here applies to a class template as well.","width":230},{"text":"Any question about the function addEm?","width":217},{"text":"Addem. No questions about the function addEm. Its okay.","width":397},{"text":"Alright, now I of course have questions for you. I want to know how this does. So look at this client code, the code that uses addEm and speculate on what each of these function calls returns.","width":1193},{"text":"Speculate on what happens when you run this code or when you compile this code.","width":433},{"text":"Okay what happens when you've compiled this code? What do you think?","width":742},{"text":"Works fine?","width":243},{"text":"It doesn't work and it doesnt compile. Tell me why?","width":603},{"text":"If these are the line numbers in the code and the compiler tells you what line fails. Which of those fails?","width":468},{"text":"Four. Thats right.","width":139},{"text":"So, suppose I get rid of line four. So line four doesnt compile because. Actually, well someone else describe it.","width":601},{"text":"Say my sentence for me. Somebody raise their hand and say my sentence for me. Why does line 4 not compile?","width":424},{"text":"Why?","width":128},{"text":"Yes ? Right, operator plus is not defined for strings plus integers. Good. Not overloaded.","width":695},{"text":"Okay fine. Suppose I get rid of line four then do you like it?","width":332},{"text":"So  I am going to get rid of line four. Then do you like it?","width":276},{"text":"Way in the back, do you like it?","width":339},{"text":"Also, line five the compiler doesn't like.","width":276},{"text":"Okay, so again operator plus is not defined for the alternative order as well.","width":456},{"text":"Okay fine.","width":49},{"text":"Then just to double check very quickly. Now assuming that this code compiles, tell me what the output is when we run it.","width":484},{"text":"Whats the output of line one here?","width":218},{"text":"Seven. Good.","width":145},{"text":"Whats the output of line two?","width":177},{"text":"7.2 thats right becasue the first template. The first template variable is the type that is returned.","width":602},{"text":"So you get 7.2","width":144},{"text":"How about here?","width":164},{"text":"Line three.","width":78},{"text":"Right it truncates to integer. Good. Any question about that?","width":315},{"text":"Alright, so I want to talk a little bit more about the compliation process.","width":417},{"text":"Because it kind of changes the way we do buisness.","width":334},{"text":"So, I am going to give you kind of a diagram of compliation as we done up until this point.","width":725},{"text":"So, imagine that this purple box includes the code for sphere.h and the green box includes the code for sphere.cpp.","width":942},{"text":"And the blue box is client code or main.cpp in this case.","width":371},{"text":"Okay.","width":64},{"text":"Now, our complilation process combines these two compiles sphere.cpp.","width":691},{"text":"And the way that it knows about header is because we have pound included sphere.h here.","width":690},{"text":"Okay, any questions about that.","width":135},{"text":"So we can compile those files together into a .o file.","width":516}]
