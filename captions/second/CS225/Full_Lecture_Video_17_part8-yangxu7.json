[{"text":"Well, I will let you vote. it's not gonna matter all that much.","width":303},{"text":"I'm gonna put e here","width":312},{"text":"and I'm gonna put an \"e\" here, the other end.","width":275},{"text":" And I wanna know,if I should write an \"x\" next or \"n\"","width":256},{"text":"Okay? So raise your hand if I should write a \"x\" next. So the exiting from the structure will happen here","width":422},{"text":"","width":10},{"text":"","width":10},{"text":"Or \"n\" next. Because the entrance into the queue should happen here, ok?","width":283},{"text":"You guys are voting. It's democratic, okay?","width":192},{"text":"All right, so raise your hand if you think I should write an \"x\"","width":278},{"text":"Raise your hand if you think I should write \"n\"","width":225},{"text":"All right, fine. It's all right.","width":192},{"text":"Raise your hand if you want vote again?","width":181},{"text":"Ok. Raise the hand if you think I should write \"x\"","width":262},{"text":"Then raise your hand if you think I should write \"n\"","width":198},{"text":"Ok, \"n\" still wins. I tried \"x\"s. I tried.","width":219},{"text":"","width":128},{"text":"","width":29},{"text":"All right. So the entry into the structure is going to be at the front of the data. And the exit from is going to be here. Okay?","width":454},{"text":"","width":10},{"text":"Let's see how this goes. We are going to enqueue value 3","width":322},{"text":"And you are telling me that should go right there. Yeah?","width":244},{"text":"Cause that's the entry","width":171},{"text":"enqueue(8) ","width":337},{"text":"Where should that go?","width":317},{"text":"At the entry, right? There's no room at the entry","width":320},{"text":"","width":10},{"text":"You like it? You want me to write \"x\" there instead?","width":303},{"text":"","width":10},{"text":"All right. Fine.","width":64},{"text":"Startover.So I've got bunch of these","width":192},{"text":"Put the exit there and put the entry here","width":320},{"text":"Ok? You are not gonna like this one either ","width":256},{"text":"I got three of them. Can't you tell. Ok. Enqueue three.","width":431},{"text":"","width":10},{"text":"Enqueue eight. Maybe you do like it better. Maybe I've just forgot how to do this class","width":384},{"text":"Enqueue 4. Oh this is easy. Dequeue.","width":525},{"text":"","width":64},{"text":"","width":19},{"text":"So three comes marching off","width":329},{"text":"And I gotta do that. So what are you telling me","width":515},{"text":"Who said that","width":222},{"text":"Move the exit. How am I gonna do that?","width":243},{"text":"Yeah, ok. I'm gonna change what you said","width":267},{"text":"Change the index, right? What is the entry? It's just the location. It's just the index of the array, right?","width":382},{"text":"","width":10},{"text":"So go ahead and move it. Who cares where it is. Just some small integers. That's what we gonna do","width":384},{"text":"This empty space here is going to be used to keep track of where the entry and the exit are to our contiguous collection of data ","width":832},{"text":"So I'm gonna have a integer exit and a integer entry","width":687},{"text":"And enqueue occurs at the entry and they start off both at zero I guess. Now let's play this out a little bit.","width":512},{"text":"Ok any questions about that? Do you see what are we gonna do? ","width":182},{"text":"So at this moment where I say dequeue for the first time, exit is just gonna be moved over and I just always keep track of where it is","width":640},{"text":"And in fact, where's the entry going to be? What does entry mean? ","width":364},{"text":"It's always gonna be, I'm gonna keep it is actually one pass. Sort of like size in previous example.","width":469},{"text":"So entry is just the index  showing that location and exit is just going to be the thing that leaves okay?","width":662},{"text":"Any questions about it at all?","width":192},{"text":"All right. So lets carry this out a little bit","width":537},{"text":"I’m gonna carry it out on this slide. It's gonna be a mess. Be ready for a mess? Take a deep breath and think of your dorm room. It's a mess.","width":832},{"text":"I never really moved out of my dorm room you should see my car. All right, ","width":512},{"text":"All right, enqueue seven. I'm gonna put seven in there and move entry. Dequeue becomes a matter of moving the exit and returning the a and it's very much like the whole pop. Dequeue again.","width":1280},{"text":"You are gonna return four. Enqueue two. This is gone and this is gone, sorry. Enqueue two moves entry here.","width":704},{"text":"The entry ones are on the top and they are moving to the right. See what I did there? To the right ","width":640},{"text":"I did enqueue two. I'm gonna do enqueue one. I'm gonna do enqueue three.","width":768},{"text":"I'm gonna do enqueue five. Uh-oh","width":704}]
