[{"text":"What do you think the next thing what we will going to do? We talked about the abstract data type. What is the next thing what we will going to do?","width":960},{"text":"We are talking about the implementation that's right. So how think our choices are for implementing a queue. We are implementing using a .... an array...or...a linked list. It feels deja vu.","width":1088},{"text":"Right ok. We used an array or linked list to see how it plays out. Its a surprise for me for the first things what are we talking about. Oh yeah I love it. (Queue)","width":832},{"text":"So we are going to set up a linked memory base implementation and I am playing a game with you. I assert that we only need a linked list to do this because after all you keep blowing in one away for a queue. ","width":1536},{"text":"In addition to the head, holding on to the linked list. I am giving you another pointer at the tail. And that tail is going to point directly to the last element. We are not going to mess with sentimals in this content. ","width":1408},{"text":"The tail is going to point directly to the last element. ","width":448},{"text":"I want to know from you is which of these pointers first is entry to the queue and which of them is exit from the queue? Which of them is entry to the queue and which of them is exit? ","width":1280},{"text":"I am asking you which one is the head. I will be question you about where is entry or exit from the queue? Ok. ","width":1024},{"text":"When are you ready with your answer, put your head in your head. Ok. Right. ","width":704},{"text":"Alright. So raise your hand if you think that is the entry to the queue. The head of entry is the queue. Ok...Everybody see. And raise your hand if you think the head is the exit from the queue. Ok. Good.","width":1152},{"text":"So there is a bit of disagreement here. Right.  The disagreement arises because of way the arrow is making you think. Ok. Because you think Oh look, those arrows tell the person where to go through this process. But think about it. Let's think about what we will have to do if this is the exit. Ok. ","width":1664},{"text":"If that last element is the exit, how are we going to do it. What is that code look like? What is the code look like? You got to get the hold of this guy right. You need a pointer to that know right before. How much does it cost you? Big O of n.","width":1664},{"text":"Ok so, um that's too expensive. You can do better. Ok. Let me summarize it first. Um so a tail exit is a induces-I think is right word-a linear time Big O of n a reset of the tail pointer. Ok.","width":2240},{"text":"Can we do better? Removing this one taking that in the front. Sure. So, the exit needs to be the head all this means the head is the exit.","width":1216}]
