[{"text":"of pointers, class. And there's one other teeny teeny tiny issue here.","width":640},{"text":"It's subtle.","width":192},{"text":"and it is a potential bug here when we pass around pointers.","width":704},{"text":"I'm gonna write a little piece of code and you're gonna respond","width":448},{"text":"yes?","width":512},{"text":"right. If you pass null pointers to that function, what happens?","width":576},{"text":"It's a segfault, right? so how would you fix that if you were writing that function?","width":448},{"text":"You'd have to put a conditional there, right? and you'd have to handle the issue if it is a pointer.","width":320},{"text":"So, another advantage here is that it's as fast as pointer passing without the complexity of dealing with pointers but also it can never be nulll","width":1024},{"text":"it always will have a value","width":192},{"text":"So this is like a pointer that cannot be null","width":512},{"text":"So we love it","width":384},{"text":"ok. So i'm writing in red. alright any questions about that?","width":704},{"text":"no. Nope, so the question is all about the heap","width":896},{"text":"None of this involves the heap","width":64},{"text":"All of these parameters are set up in local memory, ok all are in stack memory.
