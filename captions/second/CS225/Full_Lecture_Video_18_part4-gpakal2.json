[{"text":"*Silence*","width":1408},{"text":"Raise your hand if you went to the football game this weekend.","width":256},{"text":"Okay.","width":128},{"text":"When's the next home game. Do you know?","width":320},{"text":"The 24th is the next home game? Okay.","width":128},{"text":"On the 26th I wanna ask that question and it would warm my heart if like 80% of you say you went to the football game because the student section...it was fun. It was a big game and it was totally fun in the student section.","width":1216},{"text":"Like a third full...half maybe.","width":256},{"text":"So, I don't know.","width":192},{"text":"There were more Nebraska...I was dressed in red.","width":320},{"text":"It was a heartbreaker for me","width":64},{"text":"I know, I know.","width":64},{"text":"But it was. I know but I got out there and it was like oh my gosh. I am kind of cheering for Illinois. I was shocked by it. I kinda do want the Illini to win. It was weird.","width":896},{"text":"It was like this a come to Jesus moment","width":256},{"text":"Let me tell you","width":128},{"text":"Alright, should we work?","width":128},{"text":"Let's work.","width":64},{"text":"Alright, so I have a for loop for you.","width":320},{"text":"I have a for loop for you","width":192},{"text":"K?","width":64},{"text":"What do you normally see if this were a for loop like those you have seen before most frequently, what would you see right immediately following the letters for?","width":768},{"text":"What would you see there?","width":192},{"text":"An integer, right?","width":256},{"text":"int i = 0, right?","width":256},{"text":"So that's what fors expect. That's what the for function expects to see.","width":448},{"text":"It expects to see a type of thing that can be initialized to a start value.","width":384},{"text":"Now, in this instance what we have is not an integer. It's a generalized notion of something that can be incremented and we refer to it as an iterator.","width":960},{"text":"Okay?","width":64},{"text":"If you look at the role that the integer i plays in that place, it is something to use to iterate through some structure.","width":640},{"text":"It is incremented incrementally.","width":192},{"text":"It is incremented as by virtue of the for loop.","width":256},{"text":"And that's what you should expect to happen here for this new type of thing that we happened to be calling an iterator.","width":640},{"text":"Alright, so yes.","width":192},{"text":"Just as you normally expect to see an int var. In this case we have another kind of thing called an iterator.","width":832},{"text":"Hold on, I'mma make this right.","width":256},{"text":"So this replaces the int kind of thing.","width":320},{"text":"Okay?","width":64},{"text":"But it's just an iterator.","width":128},{"text":"Alright, fine.","width":128},{"text":"What is it","width":128},{"text":"The name of it","width":192},{"text":"It's like i.","width":64},{"text":"This is a name we happened to choose. Alright, and instead of setting it to zero which happens to be rather arbitrary as our place where we normally start counting. We're gonna use this abstract starting place called begin.","width":1280},{"text":"What normally goes here?","width":320},{"text":"It usually goes like i is less than size or something.","width":640},{"text":"Right?","width":64},{"text":"Sort of.","width":256},{"text":"Okay.","width":64},{"text":"Alright, and so now instead of that we say ok, I'm gonna take this generalized notion up to the end of whatever it is. So we go from the begin to the end.","width":832},{"text":"What is this?","width":384},{"text":"What is begin?","width":64},{"text":"It's a function, very good.","width":192},{"text":"It's a function.","width":64},{"text":"In what class does it dwell?","width":256},{"text":"The list class. The standard template library list class.","width":448},{"text":"Gives us this function called begin. What's begin's return type?","width":640},{"text":"What is begin's return type?","width":256},{"text":"Iterator.","width":192},{"text":"Right?","width":64},{"text":"It's return type is an iterator.","width":128},{"text":"How do I know that?","width":64}]
