Like we could draw like this andÂ ","width":149},{"text":"say oh you know there you started ","width":198},{"text":"travel clock in their orders determined by a","width":198},{"text":"uh...clockwise rotation around the root. ","width":256},{"text":"But we are not getting to do that. We are always going to draw them with the root at the top.","width":512},{"text":"As backwards. The root at the top. And we won't draw these arrows either, because they are always directed away from the root.","width":599},{"text":"So we won't actually draw them in most of the pictures. ","width":256},{"text":"Ok. Any questions about all that?","width":192},{"text":"Ok. So today is not tree day, it's actually rooted directed ordered tree day. ","width":598},{"text":"Ok? All right. Any questions? You good? ","width":256},{"text":"Alright. So here's the problem. ","width":229},{"text":"A classic course in a discrete data structure would spend a whole day on definitions.","width":553},{"text":"And I can't do that because it will put you to sleep.","width":233},{"text":"You will be asleep at the end of it. So what I'm gonna do instead is ask you to infer and to create your own definitions in your brains  probably review","width":648},{"text":"should be reviewed at this point.

","width":414},{"text":"And then the rest of them do intend for this to be interpreted as a rooted tree.","width":350},{"text":"So the first two, no root no direction nothing special, uh but then the rest of the exercises assume tree as rooted.","width":532},{"text":"OK? Alright, and directed, and ordered. Ok, any questions about all that? ","width":412},{"text":"So spend a few minutes doing these questions, uh, I think you can use about three minutes for this.
