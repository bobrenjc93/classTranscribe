I have some other questions about this.","width":384},{"text":" So, I'm gonna do kind of a traversal that mimics the code for the traversal.","width":640},{"text":"This traversal is going to really be a walk around the outside of the structure.","width":512},{"text":"A walk around the outside of the structure.","width":512},{"text":"How much time did that take me?
