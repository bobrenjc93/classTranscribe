additional","width":128},{"text":"yes","width":64},{"text":"ummmm","width":320},{"text":"it depends on what room it's in. so I will automatically ask for video tape of it. but it depends what room they put it in","width":576},{"text":"so I hope though um","width":128},{"text":"ah if not, you know","width":256},{"text":"the collective intelligence","width":192},{"text":"you know its","width":64},{"text":"you know you guys can recreate that sort of review experience by getting together with other people to study","width":384},{"text":"you know like","width":128},{"text":"that sort of transitive","width":64},{"text":"what they said at the review session was this. and I think that's actually a great way to study because it's good for you and the person who is telling you the stuff ummm so","width":704},{"text":"any other questions about this?","width":128},{"text":"alright. we'll keep you posted","width":128},{"text":"the exam still feels like a long way away to me so I apologize for not having a whole list yet","width":384},{"text":"seems like we've got a lot of time still","width":192},{"text":"ok","width":64},{"text":"ah the extra credit is due tonight","width":320},{"text":"how was the queue last night?","width":128},{"text":"little dicey, right?","width":192},{"text":"I think I heard that there were quite a few people on the queue last night","width":384},{"text":"maybe right after class today you might want to go maybe a good time","width":320},{"text":"ok","width":64},{"text":"so I ended last time kind of in a hurry","width":384},{"text":"and I wanted to revisit","width":128},{"text":"some of the uhhhhh very last closing thoughts from last time because","width":320},{"text":"i wanted it to be clear","width":128},{"text":"ok","width":64},{"text":"so here's the story.","width":192},{"text":"here's what we were trying to implement","width":64},{"text":"we have this chained-together memeory","width":448},{"text":"that we use as an implementation option for an adt","width":320},{"text":"now","width":64},{"text":"this adt allowed us to insert things into particular locations","width":384},{"text":"the application that you should think of I think","width":256},{"text":"or a reasonable application is like","width":192},{"text":"suppose you have a list of your ten favorite movies","width":192},{"text":"your top 10 favorite movies","width":128},{"text":"there they are","width":64},{"text":"and then you see","width":128},{"text":"minions","width":256},{"text":"they you see minions","width":128},{"text":"ok","width":64},{"text":"then you see minions","width":128},{"text":"well, you might need to change your list","width":256},{"text":"right","width":64},{"text":"so ","width":64},{"text":"at the number 3 stop, probably","width":192},{"text":"because minions is not better than prince's bride","width":192},{"text":"or","width":64},{"text":"idk what's your favorite movie?","width":192},{"text":"or back to the future","width":128},{"text":"ok","width":64},{"text":"so in the 3rd spot. you need to make space","width":256},{"text":"for minions and that means sliding everything else down","width":128},{"text":"this is the list adt","width":192},{"text":"that we are intending to implement","width":128},{"text":"ok","width":64},{"text":"any question about that","width":128},{"text":"now","width":64},{"text":"it's not some clasic data structure","width":256},{"text":"ok","width":64},{"text":"it is a this is a adt","width":192},{"text":"that we're sorting crafting for instructional purposes","width":320},{"text":"there are equivalent or there are similar ones","width":320},{"text":"but there is no sort of unified language around this particular umm adt","width":320},{"text":"ok","width":128},{"text":"now","width":64},{"text":"furthermore we were talking about implementing this insert function","width":384},{"text":"insert into the location into a particular location","width":320},{"text":"ok","width":64},{"text":"now think about what is necessary for that to happen","width":192},{"text":"you need a position and a data element that you're putting into uh the list say of movies","width":448},{"text":"ok","width":64},{"text":"that's the interface. that's what calls this function","width":192},{"text":"or what this function is called with um","width":192},{"text":"I have a question for you before we even talk about details here","width":256},{"text":"is insert() in the public or private section of the list class?","width":448},{"text":"definition","width":2175},{"text":"is it in the public or private section","width":128},{"text":"and when you answer. when you raise your hand to answer, I'm going to have a follow-up question","width":256},{"text":"so raise your hand and answer","width":192},{"text":"somebody raise their hand to volunteer","width":128},{"text":"yes","width":64},{"text":"it's in public","width":64},{"text":"how did you know","width":64},{"text":"what did you check","width":64}]
