[{"text":"Welcome to the wreck stress in this semester.","width":128},{"text":"How do you do that syntactically much like you do for functions you prefix the class definition with template syntax","width":768},{"text":"And then anywhere you see a t, inside, anywhere you see a t inside the class. It is replaced with whatever you haven't put in okay?","width":832},{"text":"Alright, So lets look at this code in a little bit more detail","width":256},{"text":"I actually wanna pull out my list cause I don't wanna forget anything important and its been awhile, so.","width":576},{"text":"My notes are fantastic. They tell me start with the blue code Yay okay.","width":512},{"text":"Im gonna start with the blue code okay?","width":256},{"text":"So I am declaring one of those things, and I am recognizing that it needs a type.","width":384},{"text":"Now you can tell from the name that it is a pair of integers okay?","width":320},{"text":"The variable is, so this is the variable name, so variable 2 names has ezpair of integers","width":640},{"text":"What is this? What's going on here? Whats going on here?","width":384},{"text":"Right, I am using a constructor, right? I am using a constructor","width":256},{"text":"So I should look up here and go oh Yay. The ezpair class has a constructor that accepts these two things","width":640},{"text":" Now, at this point, I think, you can probably guess what that constructor does.","width":320},{"text":"It simply takes the two arguments and uses them to instantiate all the member variables.","width":512},{"text":"That are right here.","width":64},{"text":"So, this comes from there and the constructor.","width":192},{"text":"Any questions about that, so far?","width":192},{"text":"I think you will have questions, but lets keep going.","width":128},{"text":"Alright, so now, we also have declared get Max. ","width":384},{"text":"What does this version of getMax return?","width":320},{"text":"What does it return?","width":192},{"text":"A t, its not a t","width":256},{"text":"This code doesn't know anything about ts right?","width":256},{"text":"This doesn't know anything about t, so what does it return?","width":192},{"text":"An integer thats right","width":192},{"text":"That returns an integer.","width":256},{"text":"Okay, uhh, lets see.","width":256},{"text":"So I want to emphasize that point.","width":192},{"text":"That, this code wants you instantiate the template, you don't have to use that again","width":512},{"text":"Right? You already told the class that you want an ezpair of integers","width":384},{"text":"It is as if now this is the name of the class.","width":320},{"text":"You don't have to keep reminding it, that you are talking about integers","width":256},{"text":"Its like this is the name of the class.","width":192},{"text":"If we had said ezpair char? that would have been the type name","width":320},{"text":"and if I had said getMax and this was an ezpair char, there would have been no ambiguity okay?","width":448},{"text":"Just like display there would be no ambiguity. yea?","width":384},{"text":"So, I think the compiler, so if you just said ezpair here, I'd believe that the compiler would infer what you meant?","width":512},{"text":"So, you wouldn't have had to this?","width":192},{"text":"But, I actually when I read code? It helps me a lot to have that there.","width":384},{"text":"So yes, its optional for functionality.","width":128},{"text":"But its important for maintainability","width":320},{"text":"Alright, lets see. So lets talk about getMax.","width":384},{"text":"So if you execute this code what do you get?","width":192},{"text":"You execute this code what do you get?","width":192},{"text":"Take a look at what getMax, ohh, getMax is funky.","width":256},{"text":"What do you expect it. If you couldn't see that code up there what do you think you would get?","width":384},{"text":"A hundred, that's right now lets go look","width":128},{"text":"Now let's go look at the code.","width":192},{"text":"Alright, so getMax is implemented.","width":192},{"text":"To return an integer, right, or to return whatever the parameterized type is","width":384},{"text":"And, it set up a value for return. What is this?","width":448}]
