I can argue this combinatorially.","width":960},{"text":"The total number of nodes in the tree is all the nodes in the left subtree plus all the nodes in the right subtree,","width":576},{"text":"oh and they're the same plus the root, yes?","width":384},{"text":"What is this thing right here? How do you describe it, what is it?","width":256},{"text":"The recurrence, this is a recurrence. Are these two different things?","width":640},{"text":"Same. They're different expressions for the same idea, different expressions for the same thing. Oh yea? Prove it.","width":704},{"text":"How would you prove it? Using induction k. That discussion we just had there, that discussion we just had there was a total conversation.","width":640},{"text":"Like dinner conversation right?","width":192},{"text":"We have a recursion, an recurrence which is easy to write down, and a hypothesized solution and in order to make agreement between the two, we could do arduous arithmetic, ","width":1024},{"text":"like you did when you took calc 1, OR we could simply prove they're the same inductively","width":448},{"text":"We're not going to do it here but I just wanted to bring that up in this moment.","width":128},{"text":"Okay, any question about it? We're gonna do an inductive proof today just not here, this one is almost too trivial.","width":512},{"text":"Sorry, this should've come from the discrete math, alright any questions about it?","width":512},{"text":"Ok, so prove these two are the same. Via induction, and I'll warn you, you know,  I didn't really check this, is it h+1 here or is just h.","width":1344},{"text":"Ok alright fine, The other way you can prove it is by asking the class.","width":384},{"text":"Alright any questions about it, Alright","width":192},{"text":"Got another one for you, lets talk about a complete binary tree","width":384},{"text":"I'm just shaking my head, I'm shaking my head because if you read that english definition it stinks","width":832},{"text":"Its not a recursive, it doesn't evoke recessiveness, I mean listen to this, Its like a prefect binary tree except, not all the nodes on the bottom level are there, and moreover the nodes that are there, they're all pushed to the left ","width":1216},{"text":"The heck? The heck, what kind of definition is that? Well it turns out, to be extremely useful to us and so we're going to pursue, we're going to actually pursue making an elegant definition of it but before we do so, I wanna make sure that you could draw a picture of a complete binary tree","width":1536},{"text":"So please very quickly draw me a complete binary tree with one more node that I have, seven eight nine eleven twelve, thirteen nodes.","width":768},{"text":"Complete binary tree of thirteen nodes","width":320},{"text":"and you shouldn't start from scratch","width":192},{"text":"Yea! Right, look this is a complete binary tree with twelve nodes, where does that thirteenth one have to go?","width":768},{"text":"It has to go right here right? It has to go right here otherwise you either mess up the height, you either mess up the height","width":640},{"text":"so leaves on a bunch of different levels or you add a vertex so that you don't have everything pushed to the left","width":640},{"text":"K, so theres really only one place where that thirteenth node can go, and i'll put it in here really quickly","width":384},{"text":"Like this, ok, any  question about that?","width":320},{"text":"Alright fine, now because we like recurrence, recursive definitions so much we're going to solve the puzzle of expressing this kind of tree recursively. ","width":1088},{"text":"In this definition you can use, your definition for a perfect tree as well.","width":448},{"text":"Okay, and what I want you to do is figure out what this definition looks like, and my hint here is, my hint here is to use the example to craft one of the cases ","width":1408},{"text":"And to think what would happen if this were a tree with ten nodes, for the other case, the other piece of the defintion","width":704},{"text":"this part, and go ahead and spend a couple minutes coming up with this definition please","width":576},{"text":"the recursive case","width":128}]
