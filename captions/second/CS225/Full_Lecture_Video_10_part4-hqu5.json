[{"text":"Okay","width":64},{"text":"but","width":64},{"text":"the fact that each of those words has an opposite","width":448},{"text":"or sort of an opposite","width":64},{"text":"static opposite is dynamic early","width":320},{"text":"opposite is late","width":64},{"text":"compile time well sort of the opposite is run time","width":192},{"text":"the fact that each of thsoe words has an opposite","width":256},{"text":"and this is just the default","width":128},{"text":"means you should probably suspect there is an alternative","width":128},{"text":"okay","width":128},{"text":"alriht","width":64},{"text":"so almost it's almost certainly true","width":128},{"text":"that this behavior is not","width":192},{"text":"what's intended","width":128},{"text":"it's almost certainly","width":128},{"text":"true","width":64},{"text":"that if we were to put effort to make this a ball","width":256},{"text":"then we intended for the pointer to behave like a ball","width":448},{"text":"and so","width":64},{"text":"um","width":64},{"text":"we have a programatic mechanism","width":192},{"text":"for making that hapen","width":64},{"text":"now","width":64},{"text":"why does c++ do it like this by default","width":320},{"text":"and the answer is","width":64},{"text":"that","width":64},{"text":"this assignment","width":64},{"text":"could be","width":128},{"text":"inside a conditional","width":128},{"text":"right?","width":64},{"text":"in fact","width":64},{"text":"you could assign any derived class to a sphere pointer","width":320},{"text":"because of that, you can even necessarily figure out until runtime which","width":576},{"text":"of all the different options are necessary","width":192},{"text":"so at compile time they all have to be expanded into machine code","width":384},{"text":"now the cost of that is huge","width":192},{"text":"it makes for larger and a thereby slower executables","width":384},{"text":"so uh by default you know c++ imagines itself a racehorse","width":512},{"text":"it'ts trying to do everything fast","width":256},{"text":"so by defaut its choice is to use early binding which says okay","width":256},{"text":"im just gonna go with the declared type information as the only type information","width":448},{"text":"okay?","width":64},{"text":"any questions?","width":128},{"text":"lol","width":64},{"text":"yeah!","width":192},{"text":"silence","width":64},{"text":"silence","width":128},{"text":"um","width":256},{"text":"oh we're gonna talk about that","width":192},{"text":"i have a whole slide on destructors","width":192},{"text":"is what you're asking about right?","width":128},{"text":"like what happens in thsi world with a destructor","width":256},{"text":"very astute of you to notice","width":64},{"text":"and we have a whole slide on it","width":256},{"text":"alright","width":64},{"text":"so how do we fix the problem","width":192},{"text":"and the answer is","width":128},{"text":"we use keyword virtual","width":128},{"text":"chirp","width":128},{"text":"chirp","width":64},{"text":"silence","width":64},{"text":"wheeee","width":128},{"text":"so the virtual keyword means tha the function may be overwritten in a derived class","width":576},{"text":"more silence","width":128},{"text":"yawn","width":128},{"text":"pull out your pillow","width":64},{"text":"like actually","width":192},{"text":"there's like 5 more seconds of silence","width":384},{"text":"wheeee","width":192},{"text":"jk there's more","width":128},{"text":"chirp chirp chirp","width":128},{"text":"ok","width":64},{"text":"alright!","width":128},{"text":"and so","width":64},{"text":"now","width":64},{"text":"and so now","width":128},{"text":"this code","width":128},{"text":"will work just fine","width":128},{"text":"k?","width":192},{"text":"i put things in a conditional","width":128},{"text":"and the rigt kind of display will happen","width":256},{"text":"based on which of these assignments occurs","width":256},{"text":"k?","width":64},{"text":"so now you can imagine instead of a=0","width":192},{"text":"who knows what a is","width":64},{"text":"here","width":64},{"text":"you can imagine any conditional here like if","width":256},{"text":"the left button is pushed or the right button is pushed","width":320},{"text":"or if the temprature is over 75 degrees","width":256},{"text":"this can be any conditional","width":128},{"text":"and we can still attach at run time any kind of thing that we want","width":448},{"text":"and still get the display that we like so in the in this example","width":448},{"text":"in the case that a is 0","width":192},{"text":"we get sphere","width":192},{"text":"otherwise","width":192},{"text":"so a!=0","width":128},{"text":"we get","width":64},{"text":"ball","width":64},{"text":"k?","width":128},{"text":"that","width":64},{"text":"is polymorphism","width":128},{"text":"spooky","width":64},{"text":"because","width":64},{"text":"it we change the behavior of display based on the type of uh uh they type of uh the object","width":576},{"text":"yeah?","width":64},{"text":"oh","width":64},{"text":"there's two of you","width":64},{"text":"let's see if i stand way over here","width":320},{"text":"then you're in different palces","width":128},{"text":"places*","width":64},{"text":"very good question","width":128},{"text":"um","width":64},{"text":"um","width":64},{"text":"the question is","width":64},{"text":"do you need the virtual in both places?","width":192},{"text":"and the answer is nope","width":128},{"text":"you dont","width":64},{"text":"once the function is virtual, it will always be virtual","width":320},{"text":"k?","width":64},{"text":"so","width":64},{"text":"it's superfluous","width":128},{"text":"for me to say that","width":128},{"text":"but because code is communcation, I'm always going to say it just to remind uh future derived classes","width":640},{"text":"that display will be overwritten or can be overwritten k?","width":320},{"text":"you guys should jsut talk to eachother!","width":320},{"text":"wait","width":64},{"text":"wait then they'd be completely","width":192},{"text":"wait","width":64},{"text":"what","width":64},{"text":"huh?","width":64},{"text":"k","width":64},{"text":"don't talk to eachother","width":192},{"text":"what","width":64},{"text":"alright","width":64},{"text":"any questions about that","width":128},{"text":"so once a function is virtual","width":128},{"text":"it is virtual throughout the inheritance hierarchy","width":256},{"text":"but we are awlays diligent about writing it jsut as a reminder","width":192},{"text":"yes","width":64},{"text":"whee","width":64},{"text":"am i done yet?","width":64},{"text":"woo hooo!!!","width":128}]
