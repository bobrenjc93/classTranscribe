I'm sorry. This must be trerribly painful to listen.","width":928},{"text":"And then it does these things. It creates a new node, inserts our data inside, and then fits a pointer.","width":701},{"text":"New next euqals curr next, curr next equal new, and that's the code!","width":592},{"text":"This pointer's no longer there. When you start from the head, you see the sentinel node, then you see the one we just entered, then you see the rest of the list, which is what we intended.","width":832},{"text":"Any question about that at all?","width":128},{"text":"So how do we make this happen? ","width":384},{"text":"Well, here is a thing, the question to ask ourselves is, what do we want an empty list to look like?","width":384},{"text":"That is, when I say, when client code says: List<int> brandNewList, my brand new list.","width":1024},{"text":"What do we want an empty list to look like, and the answer is what we want it to look like. We want head to be pointing to this sentinal node, like this.","width":781},{"text":"That's it","width":199},{"text":"Cause then it's ready","width":179},{"text":"If you gonna insert into the first position, want the pointer to point right here, we create a node and we are done!","width":384},{"text":"Fix up the pointer and we are done.","width":231},{"text":"How do we do it?","width":139},{"text":"I don't know. I think what we must do is, say, head equal new listNode.","width":1098},{"text":"Depending on what the constructor looks like, we simply want listNode next equal NULL.","width":587},{"text":"So head next.","width":251},{"text":"equals Null.","width":256},{"text":"Any question about that?","width":565},{"text":"And I guess these parenthesis are optional and you don't really need those there and I am gonna erase them because we should do that.","width":896},{"text":"Any question about this? Yeah?","width":192},{"text":"You don't see what the point of the sentinal node is? Raise you hand is you agree with that question. That's a very brave question. Look at those hands.

There was no \"NULL\" before.","width":1344},{"text":"So what this empty node does,","width":320},{"text":"is it makes it so that every single data node will have a \"NULL\" before.","width":425},{"text":"There's no differece.","width":192},{"text":"in structure between the first data node and any of the others.","width":384},{"text":"Does it make sense?","width":579},{"text":"It's an empty node.
