[{"text":"UHm","width":64},{"text":"So we alreadyu","width":128},{"text":"So yes","width":64},{"text":"Theres a jump here","width":192},{"text":"You didn't know when we first talked about","width":192},{"text":"Inheritence why I was telling you that it was okay","width":128},{"text":"To have a ","width":128},{"text":"uhhhh","width":64},{"text":"pointer type","width":128},{"text":"on the left","width":128},{"text":"and a derived pointer on the right","width":192},{"text":"You didn't know where  Iwas going with that","width":192},{"text":"But we did talk about the fact taht was okay","width":256},{"text":"So this assignment is okay","width":128},{"text":"Because the thing we're making is the flower","width":256},{"text":"We're building a flower at this point","width":128},{"text":"Right here","width":64},{"text":"I'm sorry","width":64},{"text":"This is WRONG!","width":128},{"text":"That why","width":192},{"text":"","width":64},{"text":"I almost broke your brain","width":128},{"text":"","width":256},{"text":"I am so glad you asked this question","width":256},{"text":"What could I have said that could have been not confusing here?","width":576},{"text":"Daisy very good","width":64},{"text":"Thank you","width":64},{"text":"Oh my gosh","width":128},{"text":"The whole point of the whole slide","width":320},{"text":"was the word that I wrote here","width":64},{"text":"and I screwed it up","width":128},{"text":"GREAT","width":64},{"text":"come back next hour","width":192},{"text":"and the mistake will be fixed or maybe it should be made, and see if people are awake to catch it","width":384},{"text":"Alright","width":256},{"text":"","width":64},{"text":"Alright","width":64},{"text":"So","width":64},{"text":"Everything I just said is true still","width":320},{"text":"It's still okay","width":64},{"text":"to declare a flower pointer","width":192},{"text":"because there is no flower constructed there","width":192},{"text":"It would not be okay say new flower here","width":256},{"text":"because we can't build a flower","width":256},{"text":"but we can build a daisy","width":128},{"text":"any question?","width":128},{"text":"Yes?","width":64},{"text":"","width":192},{"text":"There's no slicing","width":128},{"text":"so we make a daisy","width":128},{"text":"","width":192},{"text":"Right","width":64},{"text":"RIght so the thing is though","width":192},{"text":"The problem is once you do this daisy","width":192},{"text":"You don't have access to the daisy's specific functionality","width":448},{"text":"But you do have access to the polymorphic functin","width":64},{"text":"When you prescribe wheat functionality it has to have","width":384},{"text":"They're going to have it anyway","width":192},{"text":"and they're virtual","width":64},{"text":"so we can reach through flower pointer","width":256},{"text":"make sense?","width":64},{"text":"Cause the functions are declared in the flower","width":320},{"text":"okay?'","width":64},{"text":"uhmmmmmm","width":256},{"text":"","width":64},{"text":"Oh","width":64},{"text":"Let's talk about it later","width":128},{"text":"Cause","width":64},{"text":"ANd I encourage to go experiment","width":256},{"text":"SO","width":64},{"text":"So here's the thing about inheritance","width":256},{"text":"you see it about twice in this class","width":192},{"text":"Well maybe three times","width":192},{"text":"we're doing it mostly because you're going to see it in your life","width":320},{"text":"not because you need it for data structure in our context","width":384},{"text":"So we're trained to do is increase your curiosity about it","width":320},{"text":"give you a little bit of functionality","width":256},{"text":"And move on to the stuff","width":192},{"text":"The course it about and I encourage you to experiment","width":384},{"text":"Okay","width":64},{"text":"All of that said","width":64},{"text":"uhhh","width":64},{"text":"Notice that","width":128},{"text":"I have a question for you","width":192},{"text":"What if I had done this?","width":128},{"text":"Yeah?","width":128},{"text":"uh huh","width":320},{"text":"uhm","width":256},{"text":"no","width":64},{"text":"the presence of 0 does the same thing","width":320},{"text":"If there's one of those  equal 0","width":320},{"text":"it's an abstract base class","width":192},{"text":"DId you see what i did?","width":128},{"text":"Could I do that","width":128},{"text":"Ignore that blue box","width":192},{"text":"now can I do it?","width":128},{"text":"yes?","width":64},{"text":"yes i can","width":128},{"text":"But then I have no daisy","width":256},{"text":"What this demands is that I derive from the daisy class","width":256},{"text":"and further specify is it a gerber daisy or a freeway daisy?","width":512},{"text":"This DEMANDS that we be specific","width":192},{"text":"what kind of stem we draw","width":192},{"text":"Any questions?","width":64},{"text":"Yes?","width":128},{"text":"","width":256},{"text":"Oh thats ","width":64},{"text":"There may be redundancy","width":256},{"text":"I don't the compiler will let you say equal zero without virtual","width":576}]
