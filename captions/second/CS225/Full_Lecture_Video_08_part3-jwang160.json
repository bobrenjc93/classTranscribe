[{"text":"right, so when we try to copy this string array, we try to copy this string array","width":576},{"text":"you just copy the pointer value that add atts , and that ended up tangling our memory","width":448},{"text":"okay so one way of describing our use of the heap for this string array is that we use dynamic memory","width":832},{"text":"so that heap memory is dynamic memory and that's what makes it ","width":384},{"text":"so you have to declare and define a customed copy constructor","width":256},{"text":"so, why do we need one the object?","width":192},{"text":"use this heap or dynamic memory","width":704},{"text":"at anytime you have an object that uses dynamic memory. ","width":448},{"text":"that is. if new constructor and function is a good clue","width":256},{"text":"then you need you customed copy constructor","width":128},{"text":"ok, you happy?","width":64},{"text":"good? any questions about this?","width":192},{"text":"okay? alright. So, we are not done, because we've got these complex object","width":704},{"text":"We've got these complex objects now that may or may not be declared in the heap","width":384},{"text":"If this is a sphere","width":320},{"text":"If this is a sphere, say a, then this part of it lives in the stack","width":768},{"text":"and the other part is instantiated to be a new command","width":128},{"text":"it lives in the heap, that's right","width":192},{"text":"ok, so we've got this object that has pointers all over the place","width":256},{"text":"i wanna trace a little bit piece of code, and show you where a problem occurs, or like you see where the problem occurs","width":640},{"text":"okay, so my int main here declares a sphere, its name is a","width":320},{"text":"and we are gonna pass a as in parameter to this function","width":448},{"text":"now you know at this point that a copy is made of a..cus look we've got a copy constructor","width":512},{"text":"we've got a copy is made of a on stack","width":448},{"text":"3.2, 3 oh my god","width":256},{"text":"printing out into the heap memory","width":128},{"text":"okay","width":192},{"text":"the copy constructor knows how to do that. and I'm going to ignore this one for a minute","width":320},{"text":"because it doesn't help my point any","width":192},{"text":"at this point, now, we are gonna do some competition and may ask its change ","width":512},{"text":"maybe, you know may be we just use it as an input variable, whatever","width":320},{"text":"and then, the function stops execution and controls past back","width":512},{"text":"to you know just might func","width":384},{"text":"the controls pass back","width":64},{"text":"to main","width":64},{"text":"now the questions is what happens to atts","width":320},{"text":"when control is past back what happen to atts","width":320},{"text":"it goes out of scope is one way to describe it and what happens behind the scene with something goes out of scope","width":576},{"text":"yes?
