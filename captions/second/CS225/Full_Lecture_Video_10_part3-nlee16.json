[{"text":"No it's fine! It would still be there. Because your ball class is going to clean it up. ","width":576},{"text":"So pretend that in this case I clean this up responsibly. Pretend that I cleaned that up before I make the assignment.","width":704},{"text":"Is that ok? Yes that's fine. The only thing is, so I can make this assignment but ","width":448},{"text":"s is still a sphere pointer so I can't get to the name. I can't say s.name anywhere or s.getname() ","width":640},{"text":"I can't refer to the ball class member function. So I still have to use the sphere class member functions. But the ball is still there and b still points to the ball.","width":640},{"text":"So I can still say b.getname() for example. All right, andddd","width":448},{"text":"so this is fine. But the value of s is sphere. ","width":576},{"text":"As you expect. This mess right here says this is fine, but ","width":576},{"text":"the value of s - derefenced s - is sphere type. Alright, b = s is this ok?","width":576},{"text":"Nope. compiler doesn't allow this. B = s is not ok.","width":448},{"text":"This is just a behavior - you just gotta know it. Luckily the compiler tells you when it doesn't like it.","width":704},{"text":"You probably noticed that each of these classes has a display function. And so now I'm going to ask you in which contexts","width":704},{"text":"which display goes? now just for the sake of discussion, I implemented display() so that it tells us which class it comes from in each case.","width":704},{"text":"So the sphere class display simply says \"hey I came from a sphere!\" ","width":384},{"text":"And the ball class display \"I came from a ball!\"","width":256},{"text":"And nothing else. ","width":128},{"text":"Just for the sake of illustration. So now, the question is, what happens in this example?","width":704},{"text":"s.display() gives you what? sphere! exactly what you expect! Yay!","width":576},{"text":"How about b.display() ? ","width":192},{"text":"Ball! Yay! gives you what you want!","width":576},{"text":"Gives you all the right things for the concrete objects themselves. ","width":320},{"text":"Now let's make it a little more interesting. Let's use pointers instead. ","width":448},{"text":"Soooo. I'm going to set up a sphere pointer s and make it point to something that is of type sphere. ","width":768},{"text":"doesn't really matter what the sphere looks like. And now I'm going to ask for display(), what do I get?","width":640},{"text":"sphere! good! ","width":192},{"text":"So the right thing happens. ","width":192},{"text":"Now the last example - ready? ","width":320},{"text":"Here's a sphere pointer ( * sptr) and we said last time it was okay to point to sphere class pointer to a ball! ","width":704},{"text":"So here's the sphere portion of it, and here is the name sticking down here (*drawing heap diagrams) ","width":512},{"text":"And we said that was okay. Now the question is what happens when we do sptr->display() ?","width":448},{"text":"So I'm going to ask you about what you hope for. ","width":448},{"text":"This is a reflection of your optimistic soul.","width":256},{"text":"What do you wish would happen here? Raise your hand if you wish that a sphere would be displayed!","width":512},{"text":"** students raise hands **","width":384},{"text":"Raise your hand if you hope ball is displayed here! **students raise hands **","width":320},{"text":"Did you all see that? It's about half and half. the answer is ...... *drum roll..*","width":448},{"text":"sphere is displayed! ","width":128},{"text":"Ooooooooooooh.","width":256},{"text":"*Oooooh ahhhh moment *","width":512},{"text":"So this is an example of what we call early or static binding compile time function binding!!","width":896},{"text":"I'm writing this vocabulary down here - so this is ..","width":512},{"text":"\"C++ is, by default, statically bound. Let me start over. \" **erases everything**","width":1088},{"text":"\"C++ uses static or early or compile time function binding by default.\" ","width":1408}]
