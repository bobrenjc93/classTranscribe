[{"text":"Due date ... right there and proficiency ","width":192},{"text":"exam sign up instructions","width":192},{"text":"so if you have had a data structures class and you did well in it","width":384},{"text":"and you don't want to be in this room,","width":64},{"text":"you're welcome to take the proficiency exam, and I'll tell you that the pass rate is pretty low","width":320},{"text":"Umm... and that uh, in fact very few people even take the CS225 proficiency exam.","width":384},{"text":"Some people take it and still enroll.","width":192},{"text":"Some people pass it and still enroll in the class, so I don't know what the deal is.","width":512},{"text":"The information for signing up if you think you'd like to take is that I certainly don't intend to discourage anyone from taking it.","width":384},{"text":"You are all welcome to take the exam.","width":38},{"text":"Alright. Any other questions, any questions about the announcements?","width":256},{"text":"Okay, so I left you hanging in the middle of last lecture; completely hanging. ","width":296},{"text":"In fact, we had started to define our first class. ","width":351},{"text":"In our first class","width":192},{"text":"We were defining class sphere.","width":256},{"text":"The reason why we wanted to define a new class is because we wanted to declare things of type sphere, and low and behold, sphere is not a primitive type in C++.","width":832},{"text":"So my objective and my goal is, mmm, I'm not going to be fluent with this tablet yet, and I apologize, but I'm working on it.","width":474},{"text":"My goal is to be able to make a declaration of type sphere of a variable whos variable whose name is beach ball.","width":792},{"text":"For example, okay? Now the question is how do we make that happen? The answer is to define a class whose name is sphere.","width":640},{"text":"The details of defining a class are like this","width":256},{"text":"You understand that there is this public access system, but you don't necessarily know what that means","width":446},{"text":"And a private area in the class definition","width":192},{"text":"You don't know yet what that implies, and that's okay.","width":256},{"text":"Then you go to the drawing board and you think, okay, what kind of functionality do you want from a sphere and how do you represent a sphere.","width":704},{"text":"That is, what data do we need to umm keep about a sphere. So when we talk about the representation.","width":576},{"text":"What we're really talking about is what data will characterize anything of class sphere.","width":176},{"text":"So ... raise your hand if you have an idea of data that will characterize a sphere.","width":429},{"text":"Yeah? Whether it is round or not. Guess what? We're going to implement it so that it is round","width":459},{"text":"Okay? Sphere will be round","width":128},{"text":"Okay? That is just... we'll make that happen","width":182},{"text":"Yes, so if I tell you something is a sphere and I give you its radius","width":384},{"text":"You know what that sphere is, right?","width":192},{"text":"There is only one sphere that has that radius... well, sorta","width":327},{"text":"We're going to use ... uhhh ... radius ... oh wait","width":500},{"text":"Could I use diameter instead?","width":128},{"text":"Yes, could I use surface area instead?","width":407},{"text":"That would be crazy, but yeah, because you'd have to take square root.","width":549},{"text":"How about volume? Could I use volume instead of radius to characterize my sphere?","width":384},{"text":"Is there only one sphere with volume ... whatever?","width":338},{"text":"Now, again, we are in a design discussion. Why wouldn't I use those?","width":355},{"text":"Why wouldn't I use those other things?","width":192},{"text":"Yeah? Yeah, they induce time to evaluate, right?","width":512},{"text":"Like if the only thing I care about about a sphere is its volume, then I might use its volume","width":406},{"text":"But probably, for a general purpose sphere, I can most quickly get to what I want by keeping its radius, and doing simple arithmetic","width":667},{"text":"Simple arithmetic in every direction to get the data, or the information that I want from it.","width":394},{"text":"So I'm not going to keep... you're going to have to forgive all the slide switching. That is my fist on the ... thing.","width":502},{"text":"I'm going to keep the radius. Okay? That's going to be my representative. ","width":448},{"text":"Now, the reason why we keep the radius instead of the volume, say, is taking cube roots is expensive computationally. Okay? So that's the piece of it...that is... that's the piece of it that's hard. That's why we decide on radius","width":923},{"text":"Whereas cubing something ... not expensive at all.","width":320},{"text":"Who knew? You thought they were uhhh you thought they were inverses of each other. You didn't care. We care.","width":461},{"text":"Okay, so now we know how to represent this beach ball. We're just going to keep its radius.","width":407},{"text":"Do we need any other kind of representation? ","width":188},{"text":"Yes?","width":64},{"text":"Yeah, its location","width":154},{"text":"You are absolutely right. We would probably want to keep where this sphere is to","width":412},{"text":"but the real truth is what we're designing is a stupid sphere.","width":351},{"text":"We're only going to represent it via its radius.","width":465},{"text":"We're not going to try to keep track of where it is, but we could.","width":127},{"text":"We're just gonna keep things extremely simple","width":55},{"text":"So what I'm going to say here is plus more... probably.","width":406}]
