[{"text":"Fewer iterations the while loop, right.

Time is your currency.","width":279},{"text":"Now, I argue it just doesn't matter.","width":384},{"text":"Why?","width":64},{"text":"How many fewer iterations do you get?","width":216},{"text":"How many few iterations do you get?","width":177},{"text":"n+1, that's right","width":384},{"text":"You don't put nulls on.","width":183},{"text":"so the total number of fewer iterations you get is constant per data element.","width":448},{"text":"So you are, order in total, which implies constant per data element.","width":448},{"text":"So that means you are willing to pay constant per element in order to save constant per element.","width":704},{"text":"So it's a wash.","width":128},{"text":"And it's a wash in terms of running time. Overall in terms of asymptotic running time.","width":512},{"text":"I fully intended to go implement it both ways, with the conditionals there, and without them. But I just never did.","width":551},{"text":"Now, I also want to point out that actually putting these here mean you don't need this one, right?","width":504},{"text":"You see that? You actually do save a little bit there, but it just makes the code uglier, and increases the number of test cases.","width":621},{"text":"So the upshot is kind of you want to push your if statement up, so that lots of work is done in either case.","width":565},{"text":"It's more of a software engineering class type question.","width":320},{"text":"Ok, let's see. Oh! The other complexity is that when you start the algorithm you have to be careful.","width":825},{"text":"This as it's written, with these red guys here doesn't work on an initially empty tree.","width":463},{"text":"So what you have to do is that you adopt the principle that every time you ever do an enqueue in this algorithm you check first, and that means you also have to check here.","width":958},{"text":"[Writing].","width":640},{"text":"I have a question for you, so I'm going to blurr my eyes so it's not personal. But i'm just kind of curious how you feel about this. I want to know whether you're sold on my story.","width":1206},{"text":"I think it's very intuitive that putting those nulls on there bugs you. Bugs us.","width":519},{"text":"So I want to know if my argument has been convincing, and the way I want to judge whether it's been convincing is whether you feel like if you went to implement this code yourself, whether you would use the blue or red stategy.","width":1061},{"text":"So I'm trying to tap into your inner feeling about code writing.","width":434},{"text":"Are you prepared to answer? Raise your hand if you would chose the blue strategy for writing this code, and raise your hand if you're not buying it, you would prefer the red strategy.
