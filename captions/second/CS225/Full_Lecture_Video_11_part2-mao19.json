[{"text":"hmm so we..so yes there's a jump here. you didn't know when I first talked about inheritance","width":448},{"text":"why i was telling you that it was ok to have a pointer type, base class pointer on the left and a derived","width":704},{"text":"class pointer on the right you didn't know where I was going with that but you did","width":320},{"text":"talked about the fact that that was okay. So this assignment is okay because the thing that we were making is a flower","width":640},{"text":"we are building up flower at this point. right here. Im sorry. this is wrong, this is wrong thats why","width":704},{"text":"I almost broke your brains.I am so glad you asked this question.what could I have said that would have been not very confusing here. daisy very goo","width":1280},{"text":"thank you oh my gosh. the whole point of the whole slide was the word i wrote here and I screwed it up","width":576},{"text":"great ..come back next hour that mistake would not be made or maybe it should be. ah maybe I should have do them on purpose","width":512},{"text":"just to see if people are as awake as you. alright.alright, so everything i just said is true still. Its still okay to declare a flower pointer cause there's no flower constructed there","width":1344},{"text":"it would not be okay to say that new flower here cause we can't build the flower","width":256},{"text":"but we can build a daisy, we can plant a daisy","width":192},{"text":"okay?","width":128},{"text":"alright any questions about this? you should have more questions i think yes?","width":448},{"text":"theres no slicing so we make a daisy, right , right, so the things is thought, so the problem is once you do this daisy, you don't have daisy's specific functionality","width":1088},{"text":"but you do have access to any polymorphic function. so when you prescribe what functionality it has to have, you know they are all gonna","width":640},{"text":"have it anyway and they are virtual,and, so we can't reach them through flower pointer. Does that make sense?","width":448},{"text":"because there, the,the functions are declared in the flower,okay? hmm,oh,lets talk about it later,cause lets talk about","width":1088},{"text":"it later, if they encourage it to go experiment. okay, so heres the thing about inheritance, you see it about twice in this class","width":704},{"text":"about twice.. well maybe 3 times. We are doing it mostly because you are gonna see it in your life","width":640},{"text":"not because you need it a lot for data structures in the our context","width":384},{"text":"so sort of, we are trying to do is increase your curiosity about it. give you a little bit of functionality, and then,","width":448},{"text":"move on to the stuff","width":320},{"text":"okay, so I encourage you to go experiment , but i wanna stop it. okay,","width":384},{"text":"all of that said,, hmmm, notice that , oh i have a question for you, what if i had done","width":384},{"text":"this,yea? ah-ha?  hmm,no that presence of that equal zero do the same thing. okay? ","width":1280},{"text":"if it is one of them equal zero, it is an abstract base class, okay? alright, can I do that? did you see what i did? this equals zero, can i do that?","width":640},{"text":"ignore the blue box, now can I do it?","width":256},{"text":"yes, i can. But then i can't do them, i have no daisy, right? what this demands is that","width":640},{"text":"i derive from the daisy class and further specify well, is it a gerbera daisy or freeway daisy","width":448},{"text":"right? so this demands that we'll be specific about the kind of stem that we draw apparently","width":512},{"text":"okay, any question about it, yes? oh there may be sort of some redundancy there, infact","width":704},{"text":"i don't think the compile will let you say equal zero without putting virtual","width":384}]
