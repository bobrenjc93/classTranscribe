It would still be fine, it would still be there.","width":256},{"text":"Because the ball class is gonna clean it up ","width":128},{"text":"Ok, so right so pretend that in this case I cleaned this up responsibly.","width":448},{"text":"Pretend I cleaned that up responsibly before I made the assignment. So is that okay?","width":448},{"text":"Yeah that's fine","width":128},{"text":"The only thing is, so I can make this assignment but s is still a sphere pointer so I can't get the name.","width":576},{"text":"I can't say s dot name any where or s dot get name. I can't refer to the ball class member functions I still have to use only the sphere class member functions.","width":640},{"text":"But the ball is still there and b still points to the ball so I can still say b dot get name","width":576},{"text":"for example","width":64},{"text":"alright, and so this is fine","width":256},{"text":"but, s, the value of s is sphere.","width":512},{"text":"As you would expect","width":128},{"text":"That's dereferencing. This mess right here says this is fine, but the value of s dereference s is sphere type","width":768},{"text":"Alright, b equals s, is that okay?","width":256},{"text":"no, compiler doesn't allow that so that's not okay","width":256},{"text":"good, this is just the behavior right, like there's no - you just gotta know it.","width":640},{"text":"Luckily the compiler tells you when it doesn't like it.","width":192},{"text":"You probably noticed that each of these classes has a display function","width":512},{"text":"and so now I'm going to as you in which contexts, which display goes.
