[{"text":"[Video Playing]","width":64},{"text":"And then we place the new data element in.","width":192},{"text":"And now here is the beautiful moment.","width":256},{"text":"Look at this.","width":64},{"text":"Look at how much piece we have bought ourselves.","width":192},{"text":"We don't have to worry about new data.","width":256},{"text":"We don't have to worry about new data arriving through this long.","width":320},{"text":"That is a super long time. Right?","width":192},{"text":"In fact, it is almost this much data as we already have in the limit.","width":448},{"text":"We are effectively buying ourselves relaxation in proportion to this, you know, stressful copying.","width":512},{"text":"Okay? Is that make sense to you what I am saying there?","width":320},{"text":"Look. You know. Bring it on.","width":64},{"text":"Bring more data.","width":64},{"text":"I've got no problem. I've got space for it.","width":192},{"text":"Questions about it?","width":256},{"text":"Yeah? ","width":128},{"text":"Oh I am gonna address that in just a minute, okay?","width":320},{"text":"I am gonna address that. I have a whole slide about it, okay?","width":192},{"text":"Alright. So we are specifically talking about an array and why and how we are using an array here.","width":384},{"text":"Okay. So, think about what this means.","width":256},{"text":"It means that, Uh, where should I start this.","width":384},{"text":"Oh, I will start here.","width":192},{"text":"It means that we've got fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, right?","width":512},{"text":"All that, no waiting. Perfectly fine.","width":64},{"text":"And then, when something comes along here.","width":256},{"text":"We've got waiting time for data to be copied.","width":832},{"text":"And then, things move fast again, right?","width":384},{"text":"So imagine, imagine what this means in the algorithm.","width":128},{"text":"It means over the course of your use of your stack.","width":320},{"text":"Sometimes things are going great. Right?","width":128},{"text":"No problem and sometimes you have to wait a little bit.","width":320},{"text":"Now any time, you don't have the same thing going on each time becoming complex.","width":384},{"text":"So what we are gonna do, is we are gonna add up that we insert, right, n items.","width":512},{"text":"Okay, we are gonna also look at the amount of time that we spend waiting over that time.","width":704},{"text":"And it turns out, that if you at the amount of time you spend waiting.","width":576},{"text":"You will get wait time on the order of n.","width":320},{"text":"Or constant time on average per push.","width":448},{"text":"Okay?","width":64},{"text":"Is that make sense to you ?","width":128},{"text":"So, It is a rare long wait.","width":320},{"text":"Alright.","width":192},{"text":"So the punch line is its order n for n pushes.","width":576},{"text":"The analysis of that comes from last time was a geometric sum. I believe.","width":704},{"text":"Just a little geometric sum, which means big O over n.","width":512},{"text":"And you know you can go back to look at your discrete math.","width":192},{"text":"homework for proving this.","width":256},{"text":"That this is bigO of 1 per push.","width":448},{"text":"On average, we admit some of them are gonna be long, but on average, It is just like you are paying a little bit more for each one of them. ","width":576},{"text":"Some of them are gonna go faster. A few of them are gonna go way slower.","width":256},{"text":"Okay? Alright. Any questions about thatï¼Ÿ","width":192},{"text":"Yes. Who else raise their hands?","width":384},{"text":"You are number 2 in the queue.","width":64},{"text":"Yeah, go. ","width":704},{"text":"It does't matter. I mean doubling is really easy.","width":320},{"text":"So start of looking at one. Oh you mean non-one?","width":128},{"text":"Oh yeah. That it turns out that it is not gonna make a whole lot of different.","width":192},{"text":"Unless, you stack is on average much shorter than the small one you start off with.","width":320},{"text":"So if you have to believe that you stack is likely to be short, then, you know, yes.","width":512},{"text":"Okay, the other question.","width":384}]
