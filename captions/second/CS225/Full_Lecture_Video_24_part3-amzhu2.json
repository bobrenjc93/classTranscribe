[{"text":"Find. One Two. Three. ","width":256},{"text":"Oh there it is. Yeap. It was there right","width":192},{"text":"Okay so, three. So notice this is pretty cool","width":256},{"text":"It didn't have to examine the entire tree","width":256},{"text":"To determine whether or no it already was in the structure","width":256},{"text":"Alright. Any questions about it? ","width":64},{"text":"Okay, So whisper to your neighbor","width":320},{"text":"A value, that could be forty-eight right child","width":384},{"text":"forty eight's right child","width":192},{"text":"whisper to your neighbor ","width":320},{"text":"Okay. ","width":256},{"text":"Alright fine. Done? good?","width":512},{"text":"alright","width":64},{"text":"Any questions about this. ","width":128},{"text":"I'm going to come back to the applet in a minute ","width":128},{"text":"Okay. Present","width":320},{"text":"No. please. what if i say please. Good","width":320},{"text":"alright","width":320},{"text":"Okay. So, the only one of the major functions associated with","width":448},{"text":"the dictionary class and with the binary search tree","width":192},{"text":"implementation of the dictionary class","width":128},{"text":"We haven't talked about is removal ","width":128},{"text":"and I want to spend a little bit of time. ","width":256},{"text":"in fact all of the day talking about removal. ","width":128},{"text":"who knew it was so hard? ","width":192},{"text":"because actually, insert and find piece of cake","width":320},{"text":"okay, well, I went ahead and wrote the code for remove","width":320},{"text":"And I did so by cutting and pasting ","width":384},{"text":"by cutting and pasting the code from insert","width":192},{"text":"And what did i take from it?","width":128},{"text":"well? only. I only took the recursive substructure of the problem itself","width":384},{"text":"right? I only took the piece of the code","width":256},{"text":"I essentially took the piece of the code that rises as the artifact of","width":192},{"text":"The definition of definition of the binary search tree. ","width":192},{"text":"That is. A base case. and we could argue a little bit","width":384},{"text":"about what that should be. But a base case. I guess it should be ","width":128},{"text":"find not insert. ","width":256},{"text":"What to do if we are. if the thing we are looking for","width":320},{"text":"or the thing we are trying to remove is less than the key in the current node","width":384},{"text":"or what to do if it's greater than the key in the current node","width":256},{"text":"okay? any question about that?","width":256},{"text":"So we got equal to, less tahn or greater than","width":320},{"text":"equal D ","width":64},{"text":"That can't be right. Right?","width":128},{"text":"I don't know what I meant. ","width":384},{"text":"let's see which way should i fix it? This is D","width":192},{"text":"There. Now fixed ","width":64},{"text":"Oh no. okay. ","width":384},{"text":"why?","width":640},{"text":"I just called the key d instead of k? ","width":192},{"text":"Bad variable naming, but at least now it's consistent ","width":320},{"text":"alright fine. ","width":128},{"text":"This is what you want. K, k , k, k does that make you happier?","width":512},{"text":"cause kkkkey starts with kkk?","width":256},{"text":"Alright","width":128},{"text":"So I have a right? now?","width":192},{"text":"Yes? ","width":64},{"text":"Okay thank you","width":64},{"text":"There are no brain cells, ten feet, twenty feet maybe?","width":320},{"text":"No brain cells at all.","width":128},{"text":"alright so what is so hard about this?","width":64},{"text":"This can't be hard! Look, it's just a few lines of code!","width":128},{"text":"And we've seen those lines of code before. ","width":192},{"text":"The issue is ","width":192},{"text":"What the heck do we do when we do the removal?","width":192},{"text":"kay? So, I don't want to think about exactly how to make the remove right now. ","width":384},{"text":"how to make the remove happen. right now","width":192},{"text":"and so Ii'm gonna push it off. ","width":128},{"text":"Into some other function to be thought about later. ","width":256},{"text":"kay? now notice what this does from a software developer ","width":256},{"text":"development perspective ","width":128},{"text":"If I write a skeleton for this doReomval that is","width":448},{"text":"if I have the stub and just have it return whatever I want","width":192},{"text":"Then I can. Then I can test this function","width":384},{"text":"without yet ever even having to implement this one","width":320},{"text":"okay? so. This idea of decomposing our seemingly maybe difficult","width":384},{"text":"task into this. you know. these separate functions is something","width":384},{"text":"that is going to actually improve our quality of life. ","width":192},{"text":"Our debugging processes which are intricately related to ","width":320},{"text":"our quality of life. ","width":64},{"text":"So, why is this so hard? ","width":256},{"text":"Why isn't this a one liner? kind of like, find is. ","width":192},{"text":"well, ","width":192}]
