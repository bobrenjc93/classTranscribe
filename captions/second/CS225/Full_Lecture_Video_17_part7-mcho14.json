Okay?","width":178},{"text":"Plus, who wants to keep track of all those extra pointers when we don't have to?","width":256},{"text":"Just gonna mean you're gonna have bugs, okay?","width":231},{"text":"Alright! Let's see.  So what's the running time of the onqueue then?","width":303},{"text":"Constant time if we set it up wisely.","width":355},{"text":"Oh no, it's dequeue.","width":116},{"text":"Either way, so constant time either way.","width":182},{"text":"And what's the running time of dequeue?","width":192},{"text":"Constant time.","width":153},{"text":"If we are careful.","width":263},{"text":"Alright!  And, that's all I'm going to say about the linked list implementation of the queues, is that okay?","width":517},{"text":"I'm assuming at this point that you can write that code because it's just about like insert at front, right?","width":422},{"text":"Yes?","width":41},{"text":"[Student Questioning]","width":505},{"text":"So this is the queue, so the entry point is gonna be the opposite of what you choose for exit.","width":453},{"text":"So we have to be careful with exit and then entry is the other one.","width":242},{"text":"Now, what you might be asking about or what is a relevant question is what if you have some structure that allows entry and exit at either end?","width":778},{"text":"And that's called a deck, it's called a deck or double ended queue.","width":327},{"text":"And it's real thing.","width":97},{"text":"I mean it's like I think it of as kind of a perfect test question because it's something that we don't spend a lot of time on but it's perfectly within your, your grasp in terms of reasoning about how you should implement it, okay?","width":923},{"text":"So, that issue that you bring up even though you didn't intend it is actually germane, okay?","width":437},{"text":"Alright, any other question about this?","width":248},{"text":"Yes?","width":37},{"text":"[Student Questioning]","width":529},{"text":"I'm gonna throw that to the crowd, okay?","width":150},{"text":"'Cause it's a great question.","width":144},{"text":"Okay.","width":60},{"text":"So the question is if we all comment our structure, if we all comment our structure and the choice ink color here the clue, if we augment our structure with a... tail before tail","width":1257},{"text":"Yeah. Thursday a throwback Thursday, it's not Thursday!","width":260},{"text":"Ha...","width":146},{"text":"Hahaha","width":227},{"text":"If we augment it with that, do we eliminate the problem of having to reset the tail pointer?","width":640},{"text":"Well, we do but then we have a problem because we have to?","width":334},{"text":"Reset the throw back Thursday pointer, right?","width":304},{"text":"So, so, yeah it solves one problem and creates another, okay.","width":589},{"text":"Alright, any question about it?","width":155},{"text":"Okay.","width":68},{"text":"Let's see.","width":63},{"text":"So, the array based implementation of the queue","width":357},{"text":"[Silence]","width":596},{"text":"I don't know what I was gonna say about this, just absorb it.","width":260},{"text":"Meditate for seconds.","width":176},{"text":"Get in touch with the array based implementation of the queue.","width":237},{"text":"I do know what I was gonna say about it, okay.","width":185},{"text":"Any question about the set up here?","width":260},{"text":"Any question about the set up?","width":174},{"text":"Okay, you can look at it and go \"oh she must have copied and pasted it\" right?","width":329},{"text":"This slide looks a lot like the stack interface.","width":276},{"text":"It has all the same data associated with it.","width":235},{"text":"And the question is, what might we be talking about here?","width":321},{"text":"So we've spent a few minutes, kind of speculating on...","width":425},{"text":"Kind of speculating on how we might use an array for the queue.","width":313},{"text":"Now, just like we did for the linked list implementation, we need to decided where is going to be the entry and where is going to be the exit for our data, okay?","width":824},{"text":"Let me make sure I don't do something stupid here.","width":576}]
