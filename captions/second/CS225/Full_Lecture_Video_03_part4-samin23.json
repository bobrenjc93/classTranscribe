Actually its much more about also where you call it. So the here,let me get it back.","width":512},{"text":"[pause]","width":256},{"text":"Ok. So...this happened after that was processed.","width":384},{"text":"So when the main is executed it goes an looks for type definition sphere.","width":384},{"text":"[pause]","width":46},{"text":"[pause]","width":10},{"text":"It has it and so its says ok I got a sphere class and then all those things are declared","width":512},{"text":"It wont reach out to get them until it needs them","width":192},{"text":"but, that this interface up here is a promise","width":256},{"text":"that these things will be implemented somewhere.","width":256},{"text":"and that somewhere can pretty much be anywhere!","width":192},{"text":"Ok so also long as the declaration exists.","width":256},{"text":"When. Im sorry. As long as the class definition exists, when the declaration is made","width":512},{"text":"Then the implementation can be in lots of different places. But you know what, I do not like it down there.","width":342},{"text":"Thats not what readers of my code expect.","width":256},{"text":"So, I am going to put it back up here.","width":192},{"text":"In a more reasonable place.

Alright any questions about all that so far.","width":250},{"text":"Yes.","width":25},{"text":"[pause]","width":348},{"text":"It, no bang bang is the pervious line that I wrote, bang c does the previous one that starts with a C.","width":320},{"text":"Ok yes anything else? yes!","width":223},{"text":"[pause]","width":300},{"text":"demo.cpp .. O I will show you. So you know what demo.cpp looks like right?","width":320},{"text":"So the compiler is a piece of software that takes this as input and produces... this as output","width":704},{"text":"Um..cat a.out. Are you ready?","width":256},{"text":"[screaming]","width":163},{"text":"[pause]","width":336},{"text":"[confused and angry at code]","width":171},{"text":"So this is the interpretation of the context of that code. content of the code in a way that it can be shown to the screen","width":576},{"text":"Ok.

So I can do this so pound C, replicates my previous command that started with a C and then I can add dash out demo. just demo. I will just leave it demo","width":1033},{"text":"uh oh! O clear O. O. duh bang C","width":448}]
