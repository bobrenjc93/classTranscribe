[{"text":"um so the the uh name is the only thing missing, the type have to be integer, and the value oh geeze how do we give it value now cuz we no longer have X.","width":1024},{"text":"Right, here's how we give it value, we say that the value of P equals 42, so you go to  P, you follow the pointer, and you put the value inside.","width":960},{"text":"Or in other words, P is a pointer we ask for a new integer it has no name but it has a box we assign that one to P and then when you do this statement, that says go to P follow the arrow, give it value 42.","width":1472},{"text":"yes, that right, you still have to assign value to it, otherwise it is garbage, and in fact all constructor rules apply to it. ","width":768},{"text":"alright yes? possibly yes and also, so that your data so, this memory so the system is going to decide when you are done with P based on the scoping.","width":1408},{"text":"Like when you're done using P, when your function execution stops, P is going to be gone. This wont be, this will persist untill you says you're done using it. Yes?","width":832},{"text":"Um, if I have the right constructors made i can, so if I have a sphere class constructor that takes a radius, I can put a radius there. Okay are we good?","width":768},{"text":"We're okay? I think the best way to get a feel with this material is to just practice so we're going to spend a few minutes practicing. Yes?","width":512},{"text":"Yes, so new, so ill say this because i think it's helpful, new is just a function in C++ it takes an argument the int the type is the argument to the new function. ","width":960},{"text":"What does new return? what does new return? yeah? A something pointer, thats right how do you know that?","width":640},{"text":"Because on the left hand side you have to have a pointer, in the left hand side of the assignment statement, you have to have a pointer, so you know that new will return you a pointer type.","width":832},{"text":"Yes? Ohh, now your asking for me to keep going okay? Alright, I want to show you something that is very fun in that its just part of your cultural heritage.","width":1152},{"text":"Before we go on though, Much smoother about this this hour. Nope nope nope nope. I dont want you. ","width":1600},{"text":"I dont want you. and, Okay ready? Hey binky wake up it's time for pointer fun. Whats that? ","width":1216},{"text":"Learn about pointers? oh goody. Well to get started. We're going to need a couple pointers. ","width":384},{"text":"Okay, this code allocates two pointers which and point to integers. Okay I see the two pointers, but they dont seem to be pointing to anything. ","width":576},{"text":"thats right, initially pointers dont point to anything, the things they point to are called pointees and setting them up is a seperate step","width":512},{"text":"Oh right right , I knew that, the pointees are seperate, so how do you allocate a pointee. Okay,well this code allocates a new integer pointee and this part sets X to point to it.","width":768}]
