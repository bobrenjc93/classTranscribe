[{"text":"Umm either or the question is what will be the form. Oh you mean Wednesday what will happen? So the intention will always be to answer student questions. Right? Thats the best case scenario. But a lot of times, we prepare to do that and student don't come with questions. So they fall back on the review papers. ","width":1788},{"text":"No its not on the computer. The first exam will be very much like the previous exams. Though it is written by a new instructor so there is a bit more creativity involved here. ","width":1159},{"text":"But we're on the same page. Mattics don't you say we're on the same page of what constitutes a reasonable exam. Not to put any pressure on your or anything. We can duke it out. ","width":1277},{"text":"Oh yea right, that's right. Don't worry its ok. No thank you for asking that. So the exam is still written with the intention that it should take you that if you came in here you could take it during a single class hour. ","width":1918},{"text":"In the old session, in the old way of doing things that is how it always was. You came and there was some high pressure moment of taking the exam during those 50 minutes and part of the score of based on if you could finish it during that time. I think those exams written for that were probably too long to being with. Probably its not true that the average student would take 50 minute to do our exam.

But because we don't want time to be such a component of it we spread it out to three hours. ","width":598},{"text":"Two and a half officially but we're not going to leave until 10:30. Alright any questions ","width":782},{"text":"Its gonna be ok. I don't want you to feel like your life depends on this one time period. ","width":730},{"text":"Lets work shall we?

Now raise your hand if you never felt a pez dispenser. Raise your hands if you never felt a pez dispenser. It is a cultural experience that you really should have. There is a very characteristic feel to a pez dispenser. ","width":2742},{"text":"I should have brought more. ","width":896},{"text":"They usually don't yell at you! Alright, you can pass them around. I don't care. I want them back at the end of the hour but they could rotate around. Just to reinforce the idea that the pez dispenser as a candy dispenser Right? You put the candy in and you can only get the candy off the top. The top of the pez dispenser. This is a real problem if you have a multi-flavored stack of candy. It means in order to get to the purple down here, if you want the purple one you have to go through the top and pull them all off until you get down to the purple one. That make sense? The way I think of it is a constrained access structure. ","width":4331},{"text":"Now in terms of data I'm going to describe it like this. It is a constrained access linear structure.","width":1330}]
