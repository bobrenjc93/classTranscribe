Anybody have it? Wanna tell me?","width":448},{"text":"Did you raise your hand back there? Or were you waving at me?","width":194},{"text":"Gray shirt. Either one. What? Say it together, coordinated.","width":384},{"text":"Very good, okay. Good. Do you guys here that? Do it again. Encore, encore.","width":576},{"text":"This is what they said. N+1 Null Pointers. That to many nodes it's fine, it just means every piece of data have a little bit more memory associated with this.","width":832},{"text":"Okay? No problem. There's big blank splits. Page there. And everyone comfortable doing this?","width":576},{"text":"Because that means I'm going to do a lot of the talking.","width":256},{"text":"So, well, we'll plunge in. ","width":256},{"text":"So I need to prove this. This is a theorem, theorem that's bad for prove.","width":448},{"text":"And I'm going to do it by induction on the number of nodes.","width":576},{"text":"Which corresponds to the number of data elements.","width":600},{"text":"Alright","width":320},{"text":"Consider an arbitrary binary tree.","width":512},{"text":"with N nodes","width":347},{"text":"We'll prove that it has N+1 Null Pointers, okay?","width":294},{"text":"And I'm gonna call it T.","width":623},{"text":"So this is just set up, right?

You guys did it last time.","width":256},{"text":"Yah, we represent it in the empty tree with one Null Pointer.","width":896},{"text":"So the theorem holds. Yes?","width":704},{"text":"Any question about it? Okay let's do case two.","width":448},{"text":"T is not empty. So it is a root together with TL and TR.","width":640},{"text":"Okay.
