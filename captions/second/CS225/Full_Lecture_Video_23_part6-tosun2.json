But clearly this is not a binary search tree so what's missing here?","width":832},{"text":"Must be true recursively. So Tₗ and Tᵣ are binary search trees.","width":640},{"text":"Okay any question about it?","width":384},{"text":"Alrigh so umm","width":704},{"text":"Last time, uh oh we're in trouble because you're flipping your page and we're like...","width":448},{"text":"Oh it's perfect, we're going to finish today","width":384},{"text":"Last time, when we talked about binary trees, I actually gave you a slide that just looked like this except there was no data in the TreeNode structure. So I pretty much gave you this slide but right before talked implementation, but I didn't talk about it, the reason was because in a general binary tree insert, and remove are ill-defined. We don't have a prescription for where our data can be.","width":2572},{"text":"For our general binary tree we can just put it anywhere we want and when we go looking for it we have to employ a traversal.","width":495},{"text":"So find, as we saw in the previous part of the today was just traversal.","width":384},{"text":"So but now now the world changes. Because now if I give you a piece of data. Say I give you I don't know 22.","width":832},{"text":"If I give you 22, and say: \"where should I put this in the tree?\" You can go you can start with the root and go \"I don't know where 22 goes\"  but I do know it has to go in 38's left subtree. And then we can do that again. Here is another tree the problem is the same I need to insert 22 into this tree and you go okay 22 can't go here because I already have a node here. I don't know where 22 goes but it has to go in 13's right subtree.","width":2880},{"text":"Oh, there is no room there.","width":384},{"text":"So again, I don't know where 22 goes but it has to go in 25's left subtree and look we've got room for it.","width":832},{"text":"There is nobody it's like goldilocks and the three bears there is no nobody... Wait no not quite like that. There is nobody in my spot... Wait, thank you.","width":1088},{"text":"There is room there so we might as well put it there ","width":320},{"text":"Alright, any question about that?","width":192},{"text":"Now look what we've just experienced. Well","width":128},{"text":"Well, we've experienced a prescription for where a piece of data goes in a binary search tree.","width":768},{"text":"So you've got a given structure, and the new piece of data comes along, it's a well-defined process for figuring out where that value goes.","width":832},{"text":"Moreover, the same thing is true for finding the value. I'm going to look for, well, you tell me what we look for. Somebody raise their hand and give us a number.","width":960},{"text":"What would be interesting?","width":64},{"text":"Oh, I know, I got a quiz for you.","width":256},{"text":"Tell me something we should look for that would require three comparisons.","width":768}]
