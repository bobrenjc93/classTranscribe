[{"text":"Tell me what that implementation is? Is you have to describe that implementation, what would you say? ","width":384},{"text":"It's an array, good. I even drew a little picture for you. Got any problems with that array?","width":576},{"text":"It can't get any bigger that's right. It's a static array and you know what? That one even won't hold your to-do list.","width":512},{"text":"Probably. It would hold my grocery list but it would not hold your to-do list. It's too small. ","width":320},{"text":"So this thing is a, the more appropriate name for it would be a short list. ","width":640},{"text":"Or a tiny list or something like that.Â ","width":128},{"text":"Okay, what is meant by size here is the actual number of elements in the list. The number of valid things in the list. ","width":704},{"text":"So what this implementation does is it sets up a potential slot but then it's intention is to, you know, put the first thing here, the second thing here, and ect..","width":832},{"text":"I'll go ahead and use your zero if you like, okay? ","width":192},{"text":"And that's the implementation. Any questions about it? ","width":320},{"text":"So notice what I'm neglecting here. I'm neglecting kind of what to do about the fact that some lists are longer. ","width":768},{"text":"We are gonna handle that in a couple different ways over the course of the next week or so. ","width":320},{"text":"But we that said, I want to talk about a little bit of a technical detail even if we used an array to implement an ordered collection of things. ","width":896},{"text":"Try to ignore for the moment the fact that this is a fixed size. We are still gonna look at the use of an array of any kind assume it's big enough in this context. ","width":640},{"text":"","width":960},{"text":"Oh because I made these an abstract base class. ","width":576},{"text":"Oh you know what I don't know what happens if you templatized type is in an abstract base class. I would have to think about that. ","width":640},{"text":"So it won't compile unless it","width":320},{"text":"So it could be an abstract base class. But that's tangling up in here templates, in a way that there are a hundred different ways of doing that and so it gets kind of ","width":1024},{"text":"Like you'd want to look at particular compilation procedures for handling that. ","width":320},{"text":"So I think you have a clear picture in your mind and I probably don't have it in mine. But it suffices to say it would be more complex. ","width":704},{"text":"But we are allowing for any old type here, so you can put any type here","width":448},{"text":"I can't go there right now","width":320},{"text":"Alright, we are we though? Let's talk about use of arrays for implementing lists in general","width":832},{"text":"Don't look at this code, but I want to talk about what it is. ","width":384},{"text":"So our process is that we need to be able to insert into a particular position in a list, and we need to be able to remove from a particular position in a list.","width":768},{"text":"Alright, I'm going to pretend that we actually.Well no I'm not gonna pretend anything. ","width":512},{"text":"Alright, I want to say insert into position 1, item I don't know. Let's put integers in because I'm not creative. ","width":896},{"text":"I wanna insert into position 1 value 3, where should I put it? ","width":320},{"text":"Zero that's fine. I'll do that. Now I want to insert into position 1 again value 4. Where should I put it?","width":704},{"text":"","width":64},{"text":"","width":512},{"text":"Position 0, okay. What should I do with the 3? Move it over. Okay okay. You are saying open up a hole for 4 and put it in right? So the 3 has to come over here ","width":960},{"text":"and the 4 goes here, yes?","width":256},{"text":"Okay, pretend that I do this a few times. Okay I'm gonna insert to postion 3 an 11, I'm gonna insert into position 4 a 5, I'm gonna insert into postion 6 a 9","width":896},{"text":"and now dot dot dot ","width":128},{"text":"I'm going to insert into position 1 a heart","width":384},{"text":"how do I do that?","width":256},{"text":"","width":192},{"text":"How do I do it?","width":192}]
