[{"text":"Oh...I don't know....okay.  Okay? ","width":448},{"text":"And now I'm going to...keep in mind, I'm gonna say something first, before I actually...oh, does that mean it's working now? I dunno. ","width":576},{"text":"Ok I'm gonna do this.  Alright just a minute...soo keep in mind that what were...","width":768},{"text":"Im gonna remove 48, but this could just be any two child nodes in some larger tree, right?","width":512},{"text":"Like this is just some subtree. So I'm gonna not remove 26 for example and I'm gonna not remove 74 because I want you to have a bigger context in which to see what's happening,","width":768},{"text":"But I want you to remember that it might just be above 48 there's this humongous binary search tree of which this is just a little part.","width":576},{"text":"Alright, so I'm going to, I'm just gonna do this once and then Ill turn it off I promise....ok nevermind sorry I didn't have you sign the auditory stimulation waiver today, so I cant be too mean to you.","width":1152},{"text":"Alright, 48...delete. Are you ready? Maybe I should slow it down. I cant read it...More options????? The interface needs to be better. Animation speed????","width":1408},{"text":"Go down....Kay, and bound type is fine, node size fine...tree size? I'm gonna make the tree bigger. No...reset...NO? No ok this is dumb....Alright close?? Alright now?? AUGHGHG of course.....Im sorry, sometimes a keyboard would just really be nice.","width":2176},{"text":"48....and delete. You ready??? Got it? Did you see what happened?? Okay!","width":1088},{"text":" Soooo what would happen if I did delete 36? What would happen? 32 would come up, that's right!","width":832},{"text":"Very good! What would happen if I deleted 74?? 73 would come up.","width":576},{"text":"What determines which one comes...which one swaps in? Its in the left side and it is...its the biggest one on the left side.  ","width":1088},{"text":" Okay we have a special name for it, its called the in order predecessor.","width":320},{"text":"Now all of the convers....I'll write it down in just a second, Any questions about it do you want to see it one more time?? yes??? YES!!! ","width":768},{"text":"you want to tell me what that other way is???  Yea sure we have a name for that too, its called the in order successor.  ","width":768},{"text":"Yeah? Is your question too yes. it was an arbitrary choice to choose the biggest one in the left subtree to swap up there we could have chosen the one in the right subtree instead.","width":960},{"text":"The key observation is when you do an in order traversal of this tree, the order is not ruined. The order of the tree is not ruined, but by removing an element and replacing it with the one whose value comes just before it, the question is where in the structure does that occur?","width":1408},{"text":" So let's go back...okay. Look at this....oh I don't have to I don't think...I can do this right??? haha there.  This is kinda easy...Alright! So remove 13.","width":1152},{"text":"We have seen the idea of in order predecessor, it is the max element in the left subtree. ","width":1472}]
