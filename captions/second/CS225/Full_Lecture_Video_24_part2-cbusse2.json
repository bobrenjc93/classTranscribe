Ok. Reload the page...cause its fun.","width":960},{"text":"Can you hear it? So this applet as a teaching device is extra awesome cause it even has sound! Ok? ","width":640},{"text":"ALright so is this a binary search tree?","width":448},{"text":"How did you check?","width":192},{"text":"What was it that you checked?","width":256},{"text":"somebody raise their hand and tell me how they checked to see if it was a binary search tree, there are a couple right answers here.","width":512},{"text":"Uhoh, i dont know what thats about. There are a couple of right answers, someone raise their hand and tell me how they checked to see if this was a binary search tree?","width":512},{"text":"Yea?","width":320},{"text":"Excellent! Ok so kind of a quick glance, making sure that the ordering property held, that particular strategy worked because the way that the tree was drawn was good right? Whoever laid out this tree didnt happen to put 48 to the right of 71. ","width":1344},{"text":"THough in a structure like this they could have, So whats another way of checking? yea?","width":576},{"text":"Good!","width":256},{"text":"Good good good!!!!!! So in order traversal of a binary search tree gives you the elements in order!!!!!!!!!!!!","width":960},{"text":"Ok so if you do an in order traversal of this thing they will be laid out in order. ","width":384},{"text":"and thats something that is a tying together of your experience of isOrdered in the lab from last week.","width":576},{"text":"Ok and then the other thing is that its binary search tree day and it would be kinda crazy of me to pull up a tree that wasn't a binary search tree to use as a class example, so ya know the prior on this is that its very likely to be a binary search tree.","width":1088},{"text":"ok so Im gonna insert into that tree and I want to insert a value that is 74's last subtree","width":704},{"text":"In 74's left subtree I want a node there. How many different values could I put there given unique keys?","width":704},{"text":"how many different values could i put such as to insert something that is 74's left child?","width":448},{"text":"Raise your hand with the answer","width":192},{"text":"No like this many....49...","width":448},{"text":"K everybody look around you should see a whole bunch of bunnies in the air.......were a peaceful bunch. Yes.","width":704},{"text":"Somebody tell me one of them. What is that...that through the speaker, is that gonna drive you crazy? Oh its fixed. K.","width":576},{"text":"UUHHHHHH","width":256},{"text":"Somebody tell me one of them? 73....k? and oh maaaannnn","width":640},{"text":"insert....[drippy sounds]","width":320},{"text":"YYYAAAaYYY!! I'm telling ya it matters doesn't it??","width":256},{"text":"Ok fine! Here's another little question for you! I wanna know how many nodes will be looked at, that is how many bounces will occur in this search for key 40?","width":1152},{"text":"Ok so Im gonna do a find of 40 and I wanna know how many nodes will be looked at.","width":512},{"text":"Interference with the mic, so if i stand over here it won't? No?","width":704},{"text":"OK should I unplug it?? You get the point right? AAAwwww!! AAAAWWWWWWW alright!","width":512},{"text":"Let's do a find on 40.","width":448}]
