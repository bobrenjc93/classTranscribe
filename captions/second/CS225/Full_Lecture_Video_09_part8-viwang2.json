[{"text":"Plus inheritance type, imply derived access, and furthermore, the most restrictive of those two applies.","width":1408},{"text":"So let's do an easy example first, ok?","width":640},{"text":"So all of these functions are public access in the base class, and it is public inheritance and so it is as if all these functions live in the public section of the derived class","width":1216},{"text":"So now, it is as if all of those don't exist there, they actually exist here, in the ball class, for when we declare a ball, ok, any question about it?","width":832},{"text":"So ok? Easy peasy?","width":320},{"text":"You already experienced a little of this when you worked with images, I believe, ok?","width":448},{"text":"Ok, fine, there's an exception to this. The exception is that the private elements in the base class are never visible to any derived class.","width":704},{"text":"So the exception: private in base are not accessible by derived classes.","width":1408},{"text":"Ok, and then, hmm... ","width":832},{"text":"Let me see what else I was going to say here.","width":448},{"text":"Oh that was it.","width":256},{"text":"Ok, there's one more thing that's key to pointing out. ","width":256},{"text":"You know, if all we ever had was private and public, things would be a little less interesting,","width":384},{"text":"But this last thing here, this last thing can be perceived as quite a restriction. So what we have is something called protected access.","width":896},{"text":"And inheritance, that for example, might allow you to declare something like \"surface area\" in which case any of these functions could access it,","width":1536},{"text":"but this would not be allowed. Ok? So, this protected is like public to a derived class, but like private to client code.","width":1152},{"text":"Ok, and so you'll see a lot of base classes with protected access sections, very common.","width":2240},{"text":"On the other hand, what is not so common is any kind of inheritance other than public,","width":448},{"text":"and certainly for this course, we will only ever use public inheritance, ok?
