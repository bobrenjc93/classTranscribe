[{"text":"Okay, let's work shall we?","width":128},{"text":"We were talking about inheritance and we are still talking about spheres.","width":384},{"text":"Maddox, the other instructor for the course came up to me this morning and said, \"You do love spheres, don't you?\"","width":448},{"text":"I don't know, we all love spheres. Who doesn't love spheres?","width":448},{"text":"But we're almost done. We're almost done talking about spheres.","width":320},{"text":"Alright, so we had two classes last time.","width":384},{"text":"One of them was the sphere class. One was the ball class.","width":256},{"text":"Do you remember the way that we described the sphere class in the context of inheritance in C++?","width":448},{"text":"Base class, that's right. So the sphere class is the base class,","width":320},{"text":"Base class... and how about class \"ball\"? It is referred to as the derived class, good.","width":896},{"text":"And, the key thing to observe here is that basically we are exercising code reuse.","width":512},{"text":"That is, if we already have a sphere class, then we can avoid re-implementing a lot of these functions if we just say we intend to use them via inheritance.","width":896},{"text":"So this is largely an issue of code reuse.","width":256},{"text":"Okay, let's see... so there are a few little behaviors that we should talk about.","width":448},{"text":"We talked about them in here a little bit last time, but I didn't get to them for the other class and so I'm going to review them for you as well.","width":704},{"text":"Oh, the other thing that I intended to say here is... from a design-- I want to talk about these two classes in particular from a design perspective for just a second.","width":896},{"text":"Notice that the ball-- a ball-- is a more specific sphere. So it's a sphere with more information.","width":896},{"text":"And furthermore, observe that the functions that are associated with the ball are concerned primarily with that added information.","width":832},{"text":"So from a design perspective, it's reasonable to think about, \"Okay, what's the functionality of the ball as it relates to the data??","width":576},{"text":"That is, what functions do I need in order to make that data accessible, usable, et cetera?","width":448},{"text":"And leave to the sphere class all the functionality that every sphere might need.","width":512},{"text":"And most of those have to do with its data. So it's just sort of a little-- I just wanted to bring it up because there's this little design checklist going on where you can ask yourself, \"Okay I need this function to go here or here\".","width":1024},{"text":"Largely, that decision is made on what kinds of data each of the classes hold.","width":448},{"text":"And how general the use of the function itself is.","width":192},{"text":"Okay, that said, let's be more concrete here. I'm going to declare a sphere, declare a ball. ","width":576},{"text":"Okay, you know what that means. It's certainly okay to declare a sphere because that's just our stupid sphere class that we've been talking about since day one, right?","width":704},{"text":"So it's okay to just declare one of these. Declaring a ball-- also perfectly fine. This is not unlike the image class and the PNG class from MP2, for example.","width":832},{"text":"Alright, now, this assignment statement-- what do you think. Do you like it?","width":384},{"text":"Assume the assignment operator is well-defined. So even if there were dynamic memory associated with these things, know the dynamic memory would be handled responsibly. So assume that generally, each of these has a well-defined assignment operator, okay?","width":1408},{"text":"That being the case, whose assignment operator would apply here?","width":384},{"text":"Sphere","width":64},{"text":"That's right, so it's sphere's assignment operator. So what is the result here?","width":448},{"text":"S stays a sphere, right? S is a sphere. It is as if and it's value is exactly like b's value except...","width":768},{"text":"This part isn't there, okay? So it's the sphere part of b. Any question about that? So this works, this is fine.","width":768},{"text":"S is the sphere part...","width":576},{"text":"...of b, okay?","width":256},{"text":"Now, how about this one?","width":256},{"text":"So now I have the b...","width":320},{"text":"I have a ball, and I want to assign to it the value of a sphere.","width":576}]
