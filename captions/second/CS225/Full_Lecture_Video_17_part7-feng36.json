Yes?","width":512},{"text":"so this is a queue so the entry point is the opposite of what you chose for exit","width":832},{"text":"so we have to be careful with exit and entry is the other one","width":320},{"text":"now what you might asking about or what is an relevant question is what if you have some structure that allows entry and exit at either end","width":768},{"text":"and that called a deck","width":128},{"text":"or double ended queue and it's a real thing","width":256},{"text":"I mean it's like I think this is a perfect test question because it something that we don't spend a lot of time on but is perfectly with in your grass in terms of reasoning about how you should implementd","width":960},{"text":"so that issue that you bring up even through you didn't intended is actually dreaming. all right any other questions about this","width":640},{"text":"yes","width":128},{"text":"I am in the through that the quad ok? cause it a great question ok","width":832},{"text":"so the question is if we all command our structure","width":320},{"text":"if we all command our structure and the choice of ink color is a glue","width":448},{"text":"if we all command our structure with a tail before tail","width":384},{"text":"yeah we love thursday not thursday ","width":384},{"text":"if we all command with that","width":576},{"text":"do we limit the problem we have having to ret the tail pointer","width":512},{"text":"well we do but then we have a problem because we have  to reset the through by thursday pointer right?","width":512},{"text":"so so yeah it's also went a problem that it create another","width":448},{"text":"all right any questions about it","width":320},{"text":"ok let's see so the array based implementation of the queue","width":640},{"text":"given touch with the array based implementation of the queue","width":1152},{"text":"I do know what I was gonna to say about it okay","width":192},{"text":"any question about the set up here, any question about the set up","width":448},{"text":"okay you can look at oh she must copy and paste it right?","width":320},{"text":"this slide looks a lot like that the stack in a face that has all the thing data associated with this","width":576},{"text":" the question is what might we be talking about here","width":320},{"text":"so let's spend a few minutes kind of speculating on ","width":256},{"text":"kind of speculating on how we might use an array for the queue","width":448},{"text":"now just like we did for the link list implementation","width":320},{"text":"we need to decide where is going to be the entry and where is going to be the exit for our data okay?","width":512},{"text":"uh.. let me make sure I don't do something stupid here","width":576}]
