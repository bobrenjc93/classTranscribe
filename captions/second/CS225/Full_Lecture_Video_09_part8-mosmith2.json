So all of these functions are public access in the base class and it is public inheritance and so it is as if all these functions live in the public section of the derived class.","width":1748},{"text":"So now it is as if all of those don't exist there. They actually exist here in the ball class for when we declare ball. Any question about it?","width":768},{"text":"You already experienced a little of this when you worked with images, I believe.","width":704},{"text":"There's an exception to this. The exception is that the private elements in the base class are never visible to any derived class.","width":911},{"text":"So the exception: private in base are not accessible.","width":768},{"text":"By derived classes","width":1035},{"text":"Okay. Let me see what else I was gonna say here.","width":987},{"text":"Okay, there's one more thing that's key to pointing out. If all we ever had was private and public, things would be a little less interesting, but this last thing here can be perceived as quite a restriction.","width":1047},{"text":"So what we have is something called protected access.","width":384},{"text":"and inheritance","width":309},{"text":"That, for example, might allow you to declare something like surface area, in which case any of these functions could access it, but this would not be allowed.","width":1643},{"text":"So this protected is like public to a derived class but like private to client code.","width":832},{"text":"[nothing]","width":1730},{"text":"So you'll see a lot of base classes with protected access sections, very common.","width":498},{"text":"On the other hand, what is not so common is any kind of inheritance other than public, and certainly for this course we will only ever use public inheritance.","width":828},{"text":"So you can kind of not worry about getting that tangled up","width":384},{"text":"Were there questions?","width":128},{"text":"[nothing]","width":320}]
