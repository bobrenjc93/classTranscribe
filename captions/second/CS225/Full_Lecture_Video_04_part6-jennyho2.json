Since we no longer have x.","width":512},{"text":"here's how we give it value. We say, the value of p equals ","width":320},{"text":"42 say","width":128},{"text":"So you go to p, follow the pointer and put the value inside","width":384},{"text":"Or in other words, p is a pointer, we ask for new integer, it has no name but it is a box","width":640},{"text":"kay, we establish that one to p","width":192},{"text":"and then when you do this statement","width":192},{"text":"That says go to p, follow the arrow, give it value 42","width":448},{"text":"","width":384},{"text":"yes, that's right, you still have to assign value to it, otherwise it is garbage, and in fact a constructor has got all the constructor rules applied there","width":768},{"text":"Possible, and also your data","width":512},{"text":"so this memory, so the system is going to decide when you are done with p based on the scoping","width":369},{"text":"like when you're done using p, when your function execution stops, p is going to be gone","width":448},{"text":"this won't be, this will persist, until you say you're done using it","width":345},{"text":"If i have the right constructors made I can, so if I have a sphere class constructor that takes the radius, I can put a radius there","width":832},{"text":"are we good, we're ok?","width":128},{"text":"I think the best way to get up to speed with this material is jsut to practice","width":256},{"text":"so we're gonna spend a few minutes practicing","width":256},{"text":"Yes!

How do you know that? because on the left hand side you have to have a pointer, on the left hand side of the assignment statement you need a pointer, so you know that new will return you a pointer type","width":896},{"text":"Ohhhh, ok, now you're asking for me to keep going","width":576},{"text":"alright, um, I want to show you something that's very fun, and that, it's just part of your cultural heritage ","width":576},{"text":"Before we go on though.","width":256},{"text":"Much smoother about this this hour, nope, nope nope I don't want you","width":1472},{"text":"Ok ready?

Oh, right right i knew that. So how to you allocate a pointee? Well this code allocates a new integer pointee, and this one sets x to point to it.","width":2416}]
