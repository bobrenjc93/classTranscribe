I can resize the puppy to one data element","width":384},{"text":" so resizing is what we want to do here","width":128},{"text":"what you wanna observe is that look it","width":128},{"text":"there's all this empty space over here","width":128},{"text":"there is all the empty space in the front of the array","width":192},{"text":"and so effectively what you are doing is wrapping the array around, you are gonna wrap the array around and move entry to its new spot","width":832},{"text":"and i'll make it a double way to kind of see","width":256},{"text":"any questions about it?","width":256},{"text":"and how do i do that functionally?","width":128},{"text":"Mod is your friend. The mod operator is your friend. Here","width":384},{"text":"oh very good. so just a second. let's get there.","width":320},{"text":"okay. so is it clear where we are here and then i'm gonna dequeue that moves this guy down here and then i'm gonna enqueue nine","width":640},{"text":"nine goes here and in fact what we end up with is this","width":256},{"text":"entry's on the top. this thing should be on the botton","width":384},{"text":"alright. any questions about it? yeah?","width":512},{"text":"you can figure out where entry goes by taking incrementing it mod tablefies and it will always just put it in the right place","width":768},{"text":"yeah so in fact in my code, my index is a mod index.","width":384},{"text":"so i know that i will never go outside of the bounds of that array because i'm always going to take mod the array size.","width":512},{"text":"alright! so lets do this a little bit more. any questions about it so far? yeah?","width":384},{"text":"i'm not quite with you yet. okay?","width":896},{"text":"hold on just a sec. i wanna just get us there for a sec","width":256},{"text":"so you guys are really bothered by the fact that we are kind of screwing up where the start of the array is. okay?","width":384},{"text":"alright! fine. let's do a couple more enqueue y, moves this, enqueue i, moves it again, enqueue s, moves it again.","width":896},{"text":"right? so now entry is here, exit is here. so that becomes a task when you enqueue right?","width":640},{"text":"are they in the same spot? has there been data, is there data in the array and are they in the same spot?","width":512},{"text":"then you can argue that the array is full. okay? alright! and of course, the next thing is dequeue so that doesn't actually happen at that moment","width":640},{"text":"but happen in a couple more a bit. we are going to keep going okay? alright!","width":192},{"text":"so. what are you gonna do? i've got this sort of gap here","width":576},{"text":"i got this sort of gap between what's in the start and what's in the rear","width":512},{"text":"what should i do?","width":640},{"text":"i'll give you a hint. the hard answer, the complex answer, the one that makes you go like huh?","width":640},{"text":"is not the right one","width":64},{"text":"i know right?","width":192},{"text":"i would set a.. okay, well, lets fix this first and then i'll tell you my stories , so let's see","width":768},{"text":"okay. alright! so all you do is totally easy. all you do is you just reset.","width":256},{"text":"you take the exit an you put it here","width":256},{"text":"and you increment. exit increment forward size number of things, items, sub, you know, k","width":768},{"text":"where k is in the element of exit up to entry mod table size","width":704},{"text":"and those go in the position 0, 1, 2, 3 up to k capacity. those go up to capacity minus one","width":896},{"text":"okay. does that make sense? so don't worry about like oh there's yeah. there are overlapping here and just start over.","width":640},{"text":"give yourself a clean slate feels great","width":128},{"text":"alright! any questions about it?","width":192},{"text":"is it good?","width":64},{"text":"i'll tell you my stories some other times, it's cute.","width":128},{"text":"alright that's all i have. look at that we did it. yay!","width":384}]
