Yup.","width":170},{"text":"Okay, any other questions about the animal class?","width":512},{"text":"The animal struct, whatever?","width":128},{"text":"Ok, it is worth noting that this semicolon is necessary.","width":296},{"text":"Just because it's such a common bug we don't want you to deal with it.","width":233},{"text":"Alright, so now let's use this class a little bit.","width":295},{"text":"These are a sequence of valid declarations.","width":407},{"text":"These are a sequence of valid declarations invoking each of the constructors that we just talked about except the no argument constructor","width":825},{"text":"So, here we are declaring a giraffe that eats leaves.

Right?","width":512},{"text":"Okay, and b is a big bear that eats you, that's right.","width":576},{"text":"So blobs and bears eat you.","width":128},{"text":"All right.","width":64},{"text":"Ok, fine, and now I'm gonna walk down just a little bit farther here and ask you about this one.","width":512},{"text":"What's going on here?","width":175},{"text":"What is it?","width":256},{"text":"You might want to use a D-word in describing this.","width":320},{"text":"","width":215},{"text":"Yeah?","width":64},{"text":"","width":128},{"text":"Yeah good.
