Can you handle being wrong about 3?","width":395},{"text":"So we gonna go on a search for 65, okay?","width":510},{"text":"Now is 38 65? This one is easy, you can now say no, okay?","width":599},{"text":"Fine, we haven't found it yet. We know where it must be. Where must it be?","width":361},{"text":"To the right","width":68},{"text":"Have we found it?","width":121},{"text":"No, so that's another comparision","width":170},{"text":"Where must it be?","width":99},{"text":"To the right, good.","width":157},{"text":"Have we found it?","width":95},{"text":"No, so that's another comparision","width":203},{"text":"Where must it be?","width":70},{"text":"To the left.","width":45},{"text":"Have we found it?","width":99},{"text":"No, that's a comparison.

I am going to spend whole lecture on remove ","width":317},{"text":"Did you have question?","width":271},{"text":"Oh, good question.","width":493},{"text":"You are two lecture ahead.","width":171},{"text":"So she is worried about the fact that it might not be the case the tree is beautiful","width":690},{"text":"Well, it actually isn't quite beautiful","width":226},{"text":"Because we have approximately the same substructure on the left as on the right.
