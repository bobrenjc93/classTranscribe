[{"text":"Yeah we refer to it as a yes you wanna tell me instead of me telling you? Say it loud.","width":400},{"text":"It's an if statement, that's right. That saved me three lines of code right there which is important here.","width":510},{"text":"Oh I don't what I intended for this but it feels like it was important.","width":312},{"text":"Actually the reason I did this is because I want you to see it, right. I want you to know that it exists.","width":401},{"text":"This is called a ternary operator and it effectively in very very simple cases replaces a conditional.","width":562},{"text":"So this is a shorthand conditional.","width":608},{"text":"Okay so it says if this then return a, otherwise return b and then assign that by return value across the equal sign to retmax and then return retmax.","width":934},{"text":"Okay there's something that should bug you about this code.","width":449},{"text":"It's very very subtle.","width":365},{"text":"And the way to think of it is think of all the things that come in pairs.","width":405},{"text":"When I say name something that comes in pairs, what's the first thing you think of?","width":384},{"text":"Shoes, okay, okay fine.","width":219},{"text":"It feels like then that we should be able to instantiate ezpair with shoes right? The shoe class.","width":591},{"text":"Right? What would happen for getmax if we did that?","width":375},{"text":"Yeah?","width":385},{"text":"That's right, very good, so did you here him?","width":174},{"text":"He said he made note of the point, I don't know what greater than means for shoes.","width":465},{"text":"I know what it means for integers. I can guess what it means for characters. I have no idea what it means for shoes.","width":413},{"text":"Um and so the implication of that is in order for that code to work on the shoe class, we would have to have overloaded the greater than operator.","width":902},{"text":"So the greater than operator must be implemented in any class using, wait, any class passed to is the right way to say it, ezpair.","width":1624},{"text":"Okay? Alright so it feels like a restriction but it's okay and the really good news about it is when the mistake is caught.","width":784},{"text":"Okay so if we tried to use ur ezpair on the shoes, who would tell us NO NO NO you can't do that? Who would do it?","width":744},{"text":"The compiler, that's right. The compiler would say I know you want to use ezpair on shoes but you can't.","width":397},{"text":"You need to define a greater than operator in order to do so.","width":256},{"text":"Okay? Any questions about that at all?","width":179},{"text":"So is a compiler demands that er this exist.","width":768},{"text":"So the compiler has to be able to look at all of the code, all of the code and determine exactly what functionality it means. Yes?","width":822},{"text":"twoNums, it's an variable, this is a variable.","width":334},{"text":"It could be frog, it could be Alex, it could be... It's just a thing that holds two numbers.","width":513},{"text":"Yeah, sure!","width":124},{"text":"What about it surprises you?","width":384}]
