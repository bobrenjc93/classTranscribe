I'm going to give you splat on the exam.","width":576},{"text":"And I'm going to do this just to be explicit, okay? Probably don't need to, but I will just do be explicit.","width":576},{"text":"Dereference s and then I can get at its value.","width":384},{"text":"As you might have noticed here, you could equivalently use s->printed to accomplish the same thing.","width":576},{"text":"It's exactly the same, just difference syntax.","width":320},{"text":"Okay, what else do we need to do?","width":128},{"text":"How do I print out the name?","width":128},{"text":"Dereference, good!","width":128},{"text":"I just needed to hear somebody say de- and then I was good.","width":384},{"text":"Ok fine, and then... Yeah guess what I can do!? I can do s->printed = True here!","width":960},{"text":"And this changes to True, yeah?","width":576},{"text":"And am I done? I should probably return just to let people know that I know I'm finished.","width":512},{"text":"Okay any questions, yeah?","width":128},{"text":"So the question is why don't I have to write return true and the answer is because this function has a different signature.","width":960},{"text":"Here is returns void, my purpose for returning true last time was for passing back the results of the computation.","width":640},{"text":"Alright, yes?","width":128},{"text":"Uh-huh?","width":192},{"text":"Yeah-huh?","width":64},{"text":"Uh-huh, yeah...","width":448},{"text":"Um... they are if you used parentheses correctly and there's a complexity in the MP because of the overloaded parentheses.","width":896},{"text":"So for the PNG class... it's a little weird... and we kind of leave that there on purpose just to have you have to untangle it... sorry.","width":576},{"text":"Okay, so are we done here? Are we done?","width":192},{"text":"Yes?","width":64},{"text":"Very good, okay!","width":320},{"text":"So notice that we cannot forget that what we're dealing with here is a pointer.","width":448},{"text":"What we're dealing with here is a pointer so this needs to be dereferenced here as well, okay?","width":640},{"text":"Now, let's contrast the previous slide and this slide.","width":256},{"text":"Who's (now this is a popularity contest) speed do you like better?","width":896},{"text":"Which is faster? Previous slide by value or pointer by value?","width":256},{"text":"Sorry, this is pointer, still by value, just pointer by value.","width":320},{"text":"Which one do you like better, speedwise?","width":256},{"text":"Pointer by value, that's right!","width":192},{"text":"Passing a pointer is no big deal, just a little teenie tiny representation of a memory location, whereas in the previous case that picture, copying that picture, is a BAD idea, even if it's super fast.","width":960},{"text":"So this (pointer) is FAST!","width":320},{"text":"Alright, fine! Who's syntax do you like better?","width":384},{"text":"(repeated)","width":128},{"text":"This one or this one?","width":256},{"text":"Like an eye test! Left or right?","width":448},{"text":"Yeah, left! Right, wait, left, okay, so the syntax here is better!","width":832},{"text":"This is cleaner code, but...","width":320},{"text":"so this is a comment on syntax, but here's the thing: it's also safer to be dealing with.","width":704},{"text":"You're less likely to make memory mistakes if you can refer to things that live on the stack, so actually the stack variables make your code less likely to be buggy.","width":640},{"text":"So it's much much much more than a pretty dress, it's the substance of the quality of the code that you create.","width":640},{"text":"So code that uses fewer pointers is less likely to have memory errors, okay?","width":512},{"text":"Any questions about that?","width":128},{"text":"So I'm going to say it as safer here, especially for us.","width":256},{"text":"Alright, any questions about that?","width":192},{"text":"So which one is better?","width":128},{"text":"Probably the second...","width":256},{"text":"Well, somebody's paying you according to how fast your code works.","width":768},{"text":"Well here's the thing, in C++ you don't have to make a compromise between the two.","width":384},{"text":"So let's look at the third way that parameters can be passed.","width":256},{"text":"This is called pass by reference.","width":192}]
