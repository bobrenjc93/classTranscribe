It's the recurrence.","width":624},{"text":"Are these two different things?  No they're different expressions for the same idea.","width":815},{"text":"But how do we prove it, using induction.","width":951},{"text":"We have a recurrence which is easy to write down and a hypothesized solution and in order to make agreement between the two we could do arduous arithmetic like from calc 1, or we could simply prove that they are the same inductively.  fffh   ","width":1882},{"text":"We're going to do an inductive proof today, just not here though.","width":812},{"text":"K, so prove that these two are the same","width":664},{"text":"Via induction, and I'll warn you that I didn't really check this, is it actually h+1 or is it h?  It's h+1.","width":1024},{"text":"Alright, how about another question, lets talk about a complete binary tree.","width":943},{"text":"If you read that english definition it stinks, it isn't recursive, it's like a perfect binary tree except not all the nodes on the bottom level are there, and moreover all the one's that are there are pushed to the left?
