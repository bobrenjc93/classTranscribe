[{"text":"of a data structure. And data structure is a little bit loosely used here, but its okay, You'll let me get away with it.","width":768},{"text":"Alright, so the first abstract data type that we are going to talk about is, dun dun dun, a list.","width":384},{"text":"Now, this is an abstract notion of a list. This is a list like your to do list for today which includes playing Frisbee outside.","width":768},{"text":"And doing your homework and studying for your exam and working and uh, I'm sorry for the stress of your lives.","width":668},{"text":"Alright, so this abstract notion of a list includes your list of things to do today, it includes your list of favorite movies, it includes, I don't know, your contact list, it includes any list that you might want to keep track of data in some ordered fashion.","width":1482},{"text":"Any question about that? Grocery list, the list of classes you go to, any collection of things where you care about their positions.","width":768},{"text":"Now, heres the cool thing about the abstract data type for the list class, and in fact for any abstract data type that we will study. C++ puts the abstract data type into the class definition, the public section of the class definition.","width":1280},{"text":"So, the cool thing is, if I asked you about the functionality of your general notion of a list, you could point to the header file, point to the class definition contained in the header file and say look, I can create you a list, that's part of its functionality, I can tell you the size of the list, you can insert new things into it in a particular spot, you can remove things from a particular spot, and you can return the data contained in a particular spot.","width":2496},{"text":"And that right there, this is the ADT for a general list. Operative word there is list. And the only reason i say general there is to distinguish it from what we thing of as a linked list.","width":1216},{"text":"This is not necessarily a linked list. Okay, notice that we can use this list, this abstract data type list, by simply looking at the public section for it, and I get to keep this secret. I don't have to tell you what data is associated with the list, i just have to promise you that i will fulfill that functionality.","width":1984},{"text":"that I will implement that abstract data type. Okay? Alright, so fine, lets get a feel for what these lists are by walking through a little bit of client code, designed to illustrate the fact that we can be functional without having to know about the implementation.","width":1280},{"text":"So the first thing we do is we initialize the thing, it is a list containing integers, that's good. And now I'm just going to use it. I'm going to insert into the first position number 4. Here is my list.","width":1280},{"text":"I'm just going to put it right here. I'm just going to put my list right here, the front of the list is on this side.","width":503},{"text":"And now I'm going to insert into the first position number 6 and now where is 4? The second position, right? You are moving things down. It's sort of like you have a list of favorite movies and you see a better movie, its not like your previous best movie disappears, rather it moves to your second best movie. And that's just how a list class is supposed to function.","width":1984},{"text":"And now I'm going to insert 8 into the front of the list. Okay. Then I am going to insert into the third position, value 0.","width":903},{"text":"Okay, so I think i put it right here. Yes? And then I will insert into the fourth position, the get item number 2, so in the end it should look something like this. And it should be sort of opaque to you what actually happened in memory when scratching out and moving around happened. That's all encapsulated away.","width":2321},{"text":"Alright, and then I want to Cout the size, we better get 5 here. I want to remove the second thing. And then i want to get the third thing, so this should give us 6. Okay?","width":1143},{"text":"So this list is really an ordered collection of items. Ordered...","width":821}]
