Ok, let's see, where are we, should we work on linked list? I think we should, Um, so ","width":768},{"text":"Um, so we had created this structure, we created this structure here of memory that is chained together","width":448},{"text":"ok, and I want you to think for just a second about this as simply that, memory that is chained together. Because this","width":704},{"text":"Designation of this thing as a linked list is merely sort of our culture's way of describing memory ","width":512},{"text":"Memory that is chained together, cause we don't like to say memory that is chained together every last time. Ok? Now ","width":384},{"text":"When you say linkedlist, you are not necessarily implying a particular implementation of a ","width":704},{"text":"Of a list, no, I'm sorry, that's exactly wrong. When you say linkedlist, you are implying a particular implementation of a  ","width":512},{"text":"list of thing. Ok? And that particular implementation happens to be this sort of chained together ","width":512},{"text":"Um, chained together pieces of memory, nodes of memory. Ok, we wrote this code","width":576},{"text":"last time, we wrote this code last time, and um it works like this, it works like this","width":640},{"text":"if I have a set of memory that is all chained together and","width":512},{"text":"Um i designate the first thing as a variable called head, the very first memory address, as variable called  ","width":640},{"text":"head, and if I say find k ","width":576},{"text":"On head, for, um, i don't know, two","width":640},{"text":"steps, find the second one effectively. What this mean, what I intend for this to mean is  ","width":640},{"text":"please, function, return me the pointer that points, that effectively walks me forward, this ","width":576},{"text":"meant steps in the structure, ok? So, head curr in this instance, in this case begins here","width":640},{"text":"And the one that I'm going to return is the one that constant to walking to forward in the list. So  ","width":576},{"text":"There's the pointer to something after taking one step, there's the pointer to something taking two steps, it is this one that   ","width":512},{"text":"I want return in that function call. Any question about that? So it's sort of if your consider yourself be in the first walk forward two steps, yeah? ","width":576},{"text":"Um, so right now, he's asking I think about  where this code go, right?","width":960},{"text":"Ah ha, ah ha, yes, right, so um the, I'm gonna say it again","width":704},{"text":"That I'm gonna change the vocabulary just a little bit, ok, so if function like this is useful to you in ","width":640},{"text":"your, in your mp, where this is not a function in the globe scope, but it's rather a function inside the list class","width":640},{"text":"then it is true you have to declare it inside the list class. See you have to add that function's declaration to the list ","width":640},{"text":"class. And we'll actually see that later today when we do the same thing here. So it's pretty astute observation to see ","width":512},{"text":"that what we have here is a function in the global scope, rather than member function of some class, like a list class, ok?

I can't remember","width":448},{"text":"Here's what I want to know, I want to know what's the running time of this function. That's a general thing that I want to ask, a lot of time that's how I ask the question","width":640},{"text":"What it means is i want the asymptotic running time that means","width":768},{"text":"approximation on the running time for input of size, some parameter N, ok. So I'm gonna write that down ","width":512},{"text":"here, just because I don't ever want you mystified for it. So when I say running time","width":448},{"text":"when I ask for the running time, of a function, what I mean is the ","width":768}]
