Right?","width":512},{"text":"We are the technologists, we are the people that are pushing forward on what the world looks like, and the instruments that are available to the world.","width":576},{"text":"So, this is an issue of equity.","width":192},{"text":"What I'm talking about here is I'm jumping on the opportunity to talk about issues of equity.","width":448},{"text":"if we're showing off, which sort of implies that we are not listening to people who might go \"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!\"","width":320},{"text":"then we're cutting off voices that might have a lot to contribute. So, that's just my exhortation to everybody in the room.","width":768},{"text":"That we do not show off, and that we be careful to listen and include everybody in our community.","width":512},{"text":"I really like our community, they have a cool community.","width":128},{"text":"Okay, so I was showing off, and it didn't work a little teeny tiny thing, my ego is not hurt by the fact it didn't work.","width":384},{"text":"But now we have something working. So this mean ban cla, the last time I started a command was cla, append -o demo, so this is just string substitution","width":832},{"text":"when I can't return right here, this command is what was instantiated and the compiler like it. There were no complaints between here and here","width":358},{"text":"and now, these are the files that exist in my current working directory.","width":512},{"text":"Any question about that? Alright, and now I should be able to go demo and why it doesn't know which demo I might be talking about, so I tell it.","width":960},{"text":"Alright, are you learning anything? My apologies if followup this is... you know.","width":448},{"text":"One more thing, I have been talking, when I look here, when I look at the list here, I've got everything in one big .cpp file","width":832},{"text":"Now suppose that my neighbor wants to implement something that uses a Sphere.","width":640},{"text":"I can go, \"Oh Virginia! I have a Sphere that I can give to you!\", but right now, my sphere is wrapped up in that cpp code.","width":1152},{"text":"It would be much more convenient if I can hand to her just the Sphere class.","width":640},{"text":"That we're creating this object and they might be useful for other code clients.","width":576},{"text":"So we want to de-couple the class from the client code. So let's see, my apologies, there may be faster way of doing this.","width":960},{"text":"But what I'm going to do is, copy demo.cpp into what I'm going to call sphere.h for now.","width":768},{"text":"And then, I'm going to vi demo.cpp","width":448},{"text":"And get rid of the sphere class definition and implementation here, and instead, I'm going to tell the system that I need it.","width":1024}]
