[{"text":"so bad it's, uhh. So bad... It's good. Okay, The key thing to notice there is sometimes if you don't include your decimal to reinforce the fact that you're not dealing with integers, the compiler will yell at you.","width":1280.4},{"text":"So, you know, that is the shortcutting a ton of ridiculous debugging time right there. ","width":320.4},{"text":"All right, any questions about that?","width":192.4},{"text":"No. Here is what I think. I think you should be sleeping. Kuhh, we had known about variable declaration for at least a semester now. ","width":576.4},{"text":"So, here is where things get a little bit more interesting. ","width":256.4},{"text":"It turns out that the set of primitive types of things we can use to declare variables is not enough.","width":384.4},{"text":" In many many almost all circumstances, in fact, we want to define our own types to use as the bases for declaring variables.","width":704.4},{"text":"Okay? In C that was structs; in JAVA it was classes and in C++ it is classes.","width":384.4},{"text":"Alright, so here's what we gonna talk about next.","width":192.4},{"text":"User defined types in C++, those are classes.","width":512.4},{"text":"Okay? And I will show you the syntax for defining a class in just a minute because I wanna start with how do you use a class once it is defined and available to you.","width":704.4},{"text":"Well, you use it.","width":128.4},{"text":"This is different. This is different than in JAVA.","width":128.4},{"text":"You use it just like you do a primitive type and, in fact, a software engineering principle says that when you write a class, you create a type that can be used just as if it is a primitive type.","width":960.4},{"text":"It is sort of one of the standards for completeness.","width":128.4},{"text":"Okay? Alright, so if it's just like a primtive type and if my class name is sphere, then I declare a variable of type \"sphere\" using this statement.","width":896.4},{"text":"Any question about it? ","width":64.4},{"text":"So now I have a sphere. ","width":64.4},{"text":"We don't yet know what a sphere is.","width":192.4},{"text":"We gonna define the class later on.","width":256.4},{"text":"For now, I just want you to see how to declare one. ","width":192.4},{"text":"Okay, so, a class is a group of two things...","width":704.4},{"text":"It is a group of a variables and functions.","width":512.4},{"text":"Now, these two words, which I will refer to as variables and functions, in other languages may have different ways being refer to.","width":704.4},{"text":"So, we may have fields, here sometimes instead of variables.","width":320.4},{"text":"We might call them member variables and I will always do that actually, almost always do that if I rememering that they are called member variables.","width":512.4},{"text":"Uh,  and functions, functions are always refered to as... methods, very good.","width":768.4},{"text":"And for those of you who came from C, the classes is not very different from a struct except for this part.","width":960.4},{"text":"Okay? a class is not very different from a struct except for this part.","width":192.4},{"text":"Any questions?","width":128.4},{"text":"And I will show you how to use that part very soon.","width":128.4},{"text":"Not quite yet, I don't think","width":128.4},{"text":"One of the things that ran wrong this morning was that the printer was broken and so, I don't have my class notes.","width":512.4},{"text":"So we are a kind of winging it.","width":64.4},{"text":"you've probably noticed.","width":192.4},{"text":"Alright, so here we go.","width":128.4},{"text":"Let's define a class.","width":64.4},{"text":"Okay?","width":128.4},{"text":"Now, here is the skeleton, here is the skeleton.","width":192.4},{"text":"Uh, we simply define class \"sphere\" [use] opening and close brackets to declare a block of code and what is different from what you've seen before is that we do have to include a semicolon in this case after the class definition.","width":1344.4},{"text":"And the reason for that is because there is a field right there that we don't use.","width":256.4},{"text":"Okay? But it exists in the language definition and so we have to end that statement.","width":384.4},{"text":"There's like this \"ghost\"  statement here.","width":128.4},{"text":"Okay?","width":64.4},{"text":"So, another common mistake to make is to forget that semicolon because it feels redundant.","width":384.4},{"text":"Feels like I put a closed bracket there and it must think I'm done with my class definition but you are not.","width":384.4},{"text":"Okay, so, well, uh, here we go.","width":384.4}]
