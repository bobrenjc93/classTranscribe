[{"text":"... collection of items, okay.","width":334},{"text":"Alright, any questions about it? Yeah? Raise, your hand, if you had that question. He said, \"How come you aren't using  zero?\" Raise your hand if you that was a question you had and you kind of wanted to ask it. Raise them hight. Okay.","width":1632},{"text":"","width":1},{"text":"I need to whisper to you, okay, because this is a secret. We are the only people in the world that worry about this.","width":1143},{"text":"Alright. Okay. So thank you for asking the question.","width":839},{"text":"I was hoping someone would.","width":128},{"text":"Ummm, yeah, so you know we're custom to indexing things by zero, right?","width":448},{"text":"But, when you are talking about a list, you know, if I ask you to write down your top five movies... If i ask your top... okay, we'll do three.","width":832},{"text":"Write down your top three movies. You can initial them, I don't care what they are, okay.","width":290},{"text":"Write down your top three movies, real quick, just so you can remind yourself \"one two and three.\" And I say, put your finger on your favorite movie, there is no ambiguity there, right?","width":592},{"text":"Like, favorite means first best. Put your favorite... put your finger on the first one you'd see if you had a chance.","width":434},{"text":"Like, there really is no ambiguity on the understanding of the first thing in a list, in the rest of the world.","width":548},{"text":"And that's what we're implementing here.","width":166},{"text":"So, raise your hand if the Princess Bride is among your top three movies?","width":256},{"text":"Okay, if you... and raise your hand if you have not seen the Princess Bride.","width":448},{"text":"Okay, so if you want to change your list, go watch the Princess Bride.","width":384},{"text":"Alright, so the point is, ummmm, whats the point? The point is that you always want to think about what the client expects.","width":888},{"text":"The world expects lists to have a first element, and that first element is not something you say \"a first element,\" right?","width":768},{"text":"You say a first element. It means one.","width":256},{"text":"And because thats what the user of your class expects, that's how you implement it.","width":517},{"text":"The interface has to behave in a way that is not unfamiliar to the people using it, okay?","width":512},{"text":"That's a little software design... a little piece of software design for you.","width":320},{"text":"Alright, any questions about that? And yes, I know, we start from zero, and there's lots of economies to be gained.","width":448},{"text":"When we right code for each other, we can start at zero, that's fine, okay?","width":384},{"text":"But when we write it for general use, we should be very sensitive about who's reading the code.","width":384},{"text":"Did you have a comment or question? You're good? Were you going to point out that we're really writing code for each other? Yeah?","width":512},{"text":"How does a destructor work for a list? Well it depends on how the list is implemented, and that's actually the next thing I want to talk about.","width":576},{"text":"So notice here that I didn't tell you how we made this happen. The implementation of an abstract data type is not necessary to be known.","width":1024},{"text":"We encapsulated it away.","width":110},{"text":"It's a separate conversation. Now it's absolutely true that we are going to be talking implementations a lot, and in great deal, but to talk about the abstract data type ermm generally, discussion of implementation is not part of the discussion.","width":1280},{"text":"Okay, ummm, let's see, but you are asking about what's my little secret, and I'll show it to you.","width":518},{"text":"Now, look at the class here. Look what I did.","width":384},{"text":"I made a list, I created a way of us implemented a list, yes?","width":303},{"text":"Yes, do you like it?","width":320}]
