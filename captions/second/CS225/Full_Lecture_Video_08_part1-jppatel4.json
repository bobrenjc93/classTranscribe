I'm from there actually. It might be the beverage of choice here, I don't know. It's like a fancy beer in Nebraska.","width":1216},{"text":"That's because it's kind of close to this one.","width":128},{"text":"Oh man, we don't have time for this. I am so sorry.","width":256},{"text":"But here's why. It's close to that and if you're from Nebraska that has meaning.","width":448},{"text":"Go Big Red.","width":64},{"text":"Right?","width":64},{"text":"And it's football season.","width":128},{"text":"Okay.","width":256},{"text":"Alright, so why is the copy constructor parameter passed by reference. Why is it passed by reference?","width":448},{"text":"Not passed blue ribbon.","width":192},{"text":"Yes?","width":64},{"text":"Exactly, very good.","width":192},{"text":"So, think about it.","width":128},{"text":"The alternative to pass, oh here we go, I have a brain. The alternative to pass by reference is pass by value.","width":704},{"text":"What happens when you pass by value is the copy constructor is invoked for you.","width":448},{"text":"But that what's we're defining here, so there's sort of recursive definition problem that exists if we try to pass my value in this context.","width":768},{"text":"I encourage you all to go write your own little class and it can even be simpler than this.","width":576},{"text":"I don't think you need any data members.","width":192},{"text":"Define your own copy constructor and see what happens if you try to pass by value.","width":448},{"text":"Why is the copy constructor parameter passed by reference? Because the alternative is passed by value.","width":1600},{"text":"Peanut butter value.","width":192},{"text":"And pass by value invokes the copy constructor.","width":640},{"text":"Which is what we're trying to define.","width":384},{"text":"So I encourage you to go test it out and see what happens when you try to set up a copy constructor pass by value.","width":1472},{"text":"Okay, another question. What does it mean that the copy constructor's parameter is constant. So I'm asking you exactly about the present of that constant there.","width":768},{"text":"I think we talked about it really really briefly. What does it mean in that context? Yes, the parameter very good. This promises that the copy constructor and the function in general will not change that parameter.","width":320}]
