[{"text":"Excellent question, can I answer that question on the next slide?","width":286},{"text":"So the question is ... what if you don't have an x","width":374},{"text":"but you have an integer pointer, does that summarize your question? Okay that's here","width":334},{"text":"So it turns out that you don't want to always have a stack variable to represent your, to have to point to ","width":509},{"text":"and in fact in this situation if you have that stack variable , you probably should just use x.","width":480},{"text":"All this indirection that's just play, as often as you can you just want to use x.","width":420},{"text":"So what are we doing this for then? What is the deal ?","width":259},{"text":"The answer is we have this other chunk of memory","width":332},{"text":"This other region of RAM called heap memory","width":431},{"text":"","width":64},{"text":"and it is memory that you control. That is you control when something is allocated from it and you control when the memory is given back to the system to use.","width":954},{"text":"Stack memory was system controlled","width":239},{"text":"and Heap memory is programatically controlled","width":315},{"text":"Now how do we do this?","width":630},{"text":"Again I got it set up so we have an integer pointer p and I want to ask for a chunk of memory.","width":600},{"text":"I'm going to do that by saying p = new int","width":453},{"text":"","width":211},{"text":"This is explicitly asking for that integer. Yo heap I need some memory","width":424},{"text":"and the heap hands me back a memory address the size of an integer somewhere ","width":455},{"text":"and this assignment statement gives that memory addressÂ ","width":432},{"text":"to the value of p","width":177},{"text":"Any question about that ? And there is no x in sight, there is no stack variable in sight","width":581},{"text":"And in fact we don't generally have a name for this ","width":392},{"text":"the name of this is really *p or the dereference of p, this target of p","width":488},{"text":"Yes?","width":82},{"text":"[pause for question]","width":336},{"text":"It creates a new one, it creates new space on the heap","width":337},{"text":"So p is, I don't know what you ummm, it , when you declare it it sets it upon the stack","width":652},{"text":"and then you can use, you can use that spot on the stack as much as you want","width":354},{"text":"[pause for another question]","width":531},{"text":"Right here? this assignment? Are you talking about b24?","width":246},{"text":"Show me what your talking about, okay p = new int","width":306},{"text":"[question]","width":365},{"text":"It will go to p's spot because p is on the left hand side, does that make sense?","width":340},{"text":"It's not scary to ask a question cause I might ask you to .. Okay yes?","width":359},{"text":"Yes very good, I can say sphere *s, s = new sphere and the sphere","width":918},{"text":"the sphere constructor is invoked but in this other space","width":305},{"text":"I've got an s and this thing is going to point to whatever that thing is.","width":358},{"text":"Any question about it?","width":141},{"text":"[question]","width":64}]
