[{"text":"You're late. This is mean to put the hand up in front isn't it? hahaha. Uh oh. OH. Ok. Ok excellent, any questions for him. I will facilitate discussion. Any questions for him? alright. thank you very much. yeah. *claps* that is the cheapest applause you're ever gonna get. ok alright fine, um did anybody have any other speculation on what this function does or any other description they'd like to add to it? so what i want to know next is what what is printer? what is printer? now yeah? it's a functor what the heck is that that's a new word. that's a new word, he said its a functor, i just wanna say it a few times because its so fun to say. try it. functor. that's right. good. ok. in fact that's correct, in fact that's correct, ok. now. but, there's a little bit of ambiguity but i asked the question for a reason. what is printer look like in a the middle of the function there? what is it look like, it looks like a function right? it is applied to some parameters right? with parenthesis so it looks like a function but where did it come from. it came in as an object, it came in as a parameter to the function so in fact, printer is what we call a function object. AKA say it, thank you. also known as a functor ok? alright any questions about that. alright fine well all of that is quite abstract, right? all of it is quite abstract so lets make it a little bit more in the context of this function, so lets make it a bit more concrete. the question is how do we make a functor? what is a functor? well take a look at this code right here, take a look at this code what does it do? overloads the parentheses operator, very good and that's it. that's all it does. it overloads the parentheses operator to do a little tricky function, a little cute function, ok? fine. now but it's a class so we can declare something of that type so the first thing i want you to do is remember the previous example declare something of type animal. anybody want to come up here and do this on my tablet for me? ok how about verbally tell me what to do. how do i declare something of type animal? you remember ? from last time. you know the struct is behind here, you can almost see, oh look look look, right here, you can see it. k? alright who wants to do this, raise your hand. somebody raise their hand, ok close your eyes and raise your hand. close your eyes and now raise your hand. chickens, you bunch of chickens. animals c is a chicken and if you remember its a big chicken that eats you. you right k. ok! so i declared an animal, now printigbig is a class, which means i can declare something of that type right? yes? right i can cover over all of this and it says class printifbig, it's not templatized or anything so i can say, printifbig ","width":20928}]
