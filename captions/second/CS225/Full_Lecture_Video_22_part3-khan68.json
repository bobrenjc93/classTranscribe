Okay, any question about it?","width":320},{"text":"The reason we are doing this in exhaustion is so that you can go back and check and make sure that mechanically you can see how these traversals go.","width":640},{"text":"Okay, there's a pair up here, what kind of traversal did you do?","width":512},{"text":"You did a level order traversal, what the heck does that mean?","width":384},{"text":"Okay fine, anybody want to guess what the heck they're talking about?","width":576},{"text":"Okay, you say what you think is on their pages.","width":512},{"text":"Let's do it really quickly, we don't expect you to get this right.","width":640},{"text":"This is golden here, what is it?","width":384},{"text":"You said c, b, d, e, slash","width":768},{"text":"Do you see what I'm doing? I'm saying what you're saying in opposite order.","width":64},{"text":"Then what are you going to say?","width":64},{"text":"Star, minus, plus, yes.","width":320},{"text":"So a level order traversal, if I were talking to my grammy, this is the order in which I would describe the data.","width":576},{"text":"'Cause it's so easy to look and go level by level and explain what data is there.","width":576},{"text":"Do we have an algorithm for this yet?","width":128},{"text":"No, gee I wonder what we're doing today.","width":384},{"text":"Okay, another pair that have the same ones. Another pair?","width":320},{"text":"Which kind did you guys use?","width":128},{"text":"Do you have a name for it?","width":128},{"text":"A pre order, okay.","width":128},{"text":"Darn it, my power in my machine is out, so I can't carry it around with me.","width":320},{"text":"So I'm going to be running with coffee","width":256},{"text":"How do you do a pre order?","width":64},{"text":"Oops, dash slash b, c, okay?","width":640},{"text":"Star, d, e, is that right?","width":384},{"text":"Plus slash b, c, star, d, e.","width":576},{"text":"And there's one last, what is it?","width":64},{"text":"Is there any pair that did an in order?","width":256},{"text":"You guys didn't?","width":192},{"text":"No pair that did an in order?","width":192},{"text":"Okay fine I'm leaving it there, you can figure out what that is.","width":256},{"text":"You guys did it, you have one? You want to tell me?","width":448},{"text":"What's an in order traversal?","width":192},{"text":"B, slash, c, plus, d, star, e, good.","width":768},{"text":"So there it is, that's in reference for you as you're going back, just another little example of a traversal to make sure that you have the mechanics of it.","width":704},{"text":"I have reason to believe that you do.","width":128},{"text":"Now, the next question is, how expensive is a traversal in terms of time?","width":448},{"text":"That is, what's the running time of a traversal?","width":192},{"text":"What would be, in terms of the amount of data it contains, what would be--","width":512},{"text":"If somebody came to you and said I have traversal code that runs in constant time, what would you do?","width":448},{"text":"So you're out on the street, and there's an algorithm truck.","width":192},{"text":"And they sell algorithms, and the have on their menu, a constant time traversal algortihm, 8 bucks.","width":640},{"text":"What do you say in response?","width":64},{"text":"It's a scam! Very good.","width":192},{"text":"Why is it a scam?","width":192},{"text":"It can't exist because if you have n pieces of data, and your objective is to look at all of them, you can't do it in constant time.","width":960},{"text":"For any constant time algorithm, there is an example of data size that will run longer than it.","width":448},{"text":"You just increase the data size until it's bigger, it just can't happen.","width":320},{"text":"The time it takes to print it out takes longer than that constant, what ever they say it is.","width":448},{"text":"Do you all see that?","width":64},{"text":"So that's a reasonable thing to think about every single time somebody tells you the running time of an algortihm.","width":512},{"text":"Does that even make sense?","width":128},{"text":"Okay fine, what if you went to a different taco truck","width":384},{"text":"So this is, I mean a different algorithm truck, this is rockin' algorithms","width":320},{"text":"The other one was Cracked.","width":128},{"text":"Cracked algorthms","width":256},{"text":"And they have a sign that said-- I'm totally riffing here, know that right?","width":960},{"text":"They had a sign that said traveral algorithms in quadratic time, 5 dollars.","width":512},{"text":"What would you say?","width":64},{"text":"What are n squared?","width":192},{"text":"What would you say?","width":128}]
