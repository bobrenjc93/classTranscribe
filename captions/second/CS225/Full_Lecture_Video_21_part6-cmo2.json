[{"text":"Anybody want to write it on my tablet?","width":64},{"text":"I will walk around and if you seem to have it I will give it to you.","width":448},{"text":"In case you are having a hard getting start it, I am going to ask you a question. What does the left subtree of this example looks like?","width":1216},{"text":"The left subtree looks like something you seem before, rather than recently. What is it?","width":512},{"text":"Anybody want to write it? ","width":1664},{"text":"um, if somebody over there wants to write I will throw this PC like a frisbee .","width":384},{"text":"That is inceptive right there. ","width":320},{"text":"No way? Alright, tell me what letter I am going to write next.","width":384},{"text":"What does this looks like?","width":256},{"text":"What letter I am going to write next? If I am filling in this blank.","width":448},{"text":"No. p right? I am going to write p. I have a symbol to represent perfect. P and how tall is it?","width":704},{"text":"How tall is it?","width":128},{"text":"P of h minus one good and what does the right subtree look like?","width":576},{"text":"C of it's height is also h minus one, good.","width":512},{"text":"Okay, any question about it?","width":128},{"text":"Okay, fine. What if these node doesn't exist?","width":448},{"text":"Then the left subtree will look like what?","width":192},{"text":"C of , good. How tall? H minus one, good. And then right subtree looks like what? I will give you the h minus two there","width":1152},{"text":"C or P? Raise your hand if you think c. Raise your hand if you think p.","width":384},{"text":"Okay","width":64},{"text":"P of h minus two, that's right. There can't be anything there","width":256},{"text":"Alright, any question about it? Good. So now, now, if you're trying to do some computation on complete binary tree, this is one way you could arrange your computation if you want.","width":832},{"text":"Writing a recursive function on complete binary trees, you just have to defined that function on perfect tree and make a bunch of recursive calls.","width":640},{"text":"Okay, alright. So, I wanted to verify for you that my English definitions were even say all nodes are pushed to the left is actually something official. ","width":960},{"text":"That is what is this link is about. It comes from nist, the National Institute of Standards and Technology. So, this is nist.gov","width":640},{"text":"um, and, I believe the ds here is for data structures. So this is the official defition. What?","width":640},{"text":"I know, isn't that sweet? Dev","width":320},{"text":"All kind of data structure something, and this is their definition in complete binary tree.","width":640},{"text":"There is one vocabulary word in the definition that we have not t talked about.","width":448}]
