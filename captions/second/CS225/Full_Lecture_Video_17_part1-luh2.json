[{"text":"I went to San Louise in Tuesday","width":640},{"text":"I am sorry","width":192},{"text":"You have a exam","width":320},{"text":"Yeah I am grateful for that freedom","width":256},{"text":"I couldn't done this last semster","width":512},{"text":"I was just completely screwed up","width":384},{"text":"I've apologized ","width":256},{"text":"it is definitely due tonight ","width":192},{"text":"The other thing that is going on","width":64},{"text":"in this window time","width":448},{"text":" I don't what window  is exactly","width":64},{"text":"but, I go over the siebel center, it is filled with people umm most notably alum","width":576},{"text":"so yes it's all the companies and stuff like that but the cool thing for me is that is people were sitting in your seat","width":512},{"text":"just a few years ago","width":128},{"text":"so they are actually yes they are known doing the recruiting thing and your are nervous about that","width":320},{"text":"talking to them but they are just like you","width":256},{"text":"just a couple years a around","width":384},{"text":"so be inspired by them  ","width":64},{"text":"start to talk with them","width":64},{"text":"don't be nervous about","width":64},{"text":"talking to them","width":64},{"text":"because we can break the chain of nervous they are really, were taken for me they were known and I know you, they were just like you ","width":576},{"text":"maybe not even quite as smart","width":128},{"text":"I am just kindding","width":192},{"text":"There is a million of definitions of smart","width":192},{"text":"so when I said that I don't even know what I mean","width":192},{"text":"should I stop talking yes","width":256},{"text":"yes","width":64},{"text":"okay","width":64},{"text":"Last time, we were talking about a new abstraction data type called a stack","width":832},{"text":"we are gonna finish up that discussion today and also complete discussion of another abstract data type","width":384},{"text":"called a queue","width":128},{"text":"that's right","width":128},{"text":"it turns out that","width":256},{"text":"stacks and queues are longed together","width":64},{"text":"In almost every data structure book ever written ","width":448},{"text":"and the reason for that is there are both contained access linear data structure","width":64},{"text":"and a lot of implementation issue are the same between the two of them ","width":384},{"text":"what's very different about the two are their application","width":192},{"text":"so as we go on through this semester","width":448},{"text":"we will see application of each of them","width":448},{"text":"notably MP4","width":64},{"text":"helps you see","width":64},{"text":"the difference ","width":320},{"text":"how to see the context of one application","width":64},{"text":"alright","width":64},{"text":"when we were implementing a stack","width":128},{"text":"with an array","width":64},{"text":"and I wanted to just ask you to revisit that I understand this is completely warm up","width":448},{"text":"Frankly, I need a warm up\\","width":192},{"text":"you might but i do","width":64},{"text":"so umm the stack has the following the public interface","width":448},{"text":"or abstract data type","width":128},{"text":"both of those are sort of interchaneble","width":128},{"text":"in terms of expression","width":128},{"text":"the function push which is a specialize notation inserting into a structure and the notion of pop() ","width":704},{"text":"which is specialized notion of removing something the structure ","width":192},{"text":"it's a linear structure that is the data is all line up ","width":448},{"text":"in our understanding of that data","width":192},{"text":"not necessarily in memory","width":128},{"text":"we can sort of think of it in line up in memory","width":256},{"text":"and as such","width":128},{"text":"when we insert and remoce","width":320},{"text":"and can take advantage of this idea","width":128},{"text":"of the data being next","width":64},{"text":"to each other","width":64},{"text":"specifically, when we push onto the stack","width":576},{"text":"so pretend it wasn't there","width":256},{"text":"the notation of next is generated there","width":142},{"text":"the next data after eight, eight becomes a first data element then the next data element ","width":448},{"text":"the next data element is six and the next data element for six is three","width":128},{"text":"and the next one for three","width":64},{"text":"is ohh I don't know","width":128},{"text":"there is no next one for three, three is the end","width":256},{"text":"so this idea is for next element is what create this is already in the structure ","width":448},{"text":"Similarly, when we pop() from the stack or when we remove elements from the stack","width":576},{"text":"we exploit this notion of next ","width":128},{"text":"because standing behind this eight ready to take its place is a value just sitting there next value","width":576},{"text":"takes its clicks ","width":192},{"text":"when eight is removed ","width":256},{"text":"for the details of a array based implemention ","width":284},{"text":"we take over the data section the data take over the private section and you see I am gonna start at the bottom  ","width":96},{"text":"what is this","width":128},{"text":"not literally but it means","width":182},{"text":"it is dynamic array good","width":64},{"text":"we will talk about that in a second","width":187},{"text":"what about this one what does it communicate","width":117}]
