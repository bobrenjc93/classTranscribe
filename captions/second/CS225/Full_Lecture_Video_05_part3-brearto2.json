[{"text":"Phew","width":128},{"text":"Ok, any questions about it?","width":320},{"text":"I'll be happy to indulge any of your questions. ","width":448},{"text":"You had a question when you came in? Oh, you did. Did this get at the question you had when you came in?","width":704},{"text":"Ok, what was your question. It was a good one. [Student responds]","width":768},{"text":"Oh, ok good. We'll try that one too. Alright, so let's go a different example.","width":512},{"text":"Here you don't want ... you don't want to even initialize the value, right?","width":1088},{"text":"You wanna try that?","width":128},{"text":"[Compiles code]","width":576},{"text":"[Segmentation fault] [Modifies code]","width":1200},{"text":"Alright, so do you all see his question? He said what happens if you try to give p value before asking for heap memory to be associated with it. And the answer is, look, you didn't ask for memory and yet you asked for p to be dereferenced so as to assign a value.","width":1426},{"text":"That moment right there is a seg fault, that's where you're trying to access memory that doesn't belong to you.","width":576},{"text":"Alright, so the upshot of that lesson is, before assigning values, to be sure to ask for heap memory to be associated with your variable.","width":640},{"text":"Any questions about it? Good good. Ok, yes? [student asking question]","width":1088},{"text":"[Opening other example to answer student question]","width":1422},{"text":"Alright, so you are asking me, after I set this to NULL... Oh, I never ran this one, did I? What are you asking me? Go ahead and ask again, sorry.","width":1984},{"text":"This one right here? Yeah, ok, so why doesn't it print NULL there? So the pointer is a variable with a type and that's a pointer type, it's not a string type. If it had said the word NULL, it would be reflecting the fact that the contents of the variable was a string or something that we could represent as a string whose value was NULL. ","width":1934},{"text":"Now, in this context, you might find that more helpful, but in fact, NULL isn't a string that's spelled N-U-L-L.","width":512},{"text":"It is a memory location that we happen to represent by that word. Moreover, it is a memory location that cannot be dereferenced. It cannot be followed. There's no place to dereference it to.","width":1344},{"text":"And so the error message if you tried to do that is a seg fault.","width":256},{"text":"Because you're trying to dereference something that isn't yours. Ok? Alright, yes? [Student question]","width":960},{"text":"No, very very very good question. And that makes me think you're ready for the next slide, because we're going to talk about that. So, her question is, are p and the thing it points to two separate variables?","width":1216},{"text":"When you give back the memory, when you say","width":320},{"text":"delete p, does that variable still exist for reassignment? And the answer is yes, watch this.","width":448},{"text":"I can in fact say here p equals new int and ask for a different piece of memory to use p to point to.","width":832},{"text":"This gets it, right, at her question. And then I can ask for the value of p.","width":640},{"text":"No, what'd I do wrong. Ok. [exasperated sigh]","width":1110}]
