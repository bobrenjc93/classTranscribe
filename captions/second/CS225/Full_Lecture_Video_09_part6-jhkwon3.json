So yes, they might both be the same, but they might do an assignment anyway and maybe that's to avoid a conditional maybe we do not know why.","width":1088},{"text":"But what we do know is that when we when we check to see if they're the same, we are essentially doing the same amount of work as an assignment anyway.","width":718},{"text":"So because you have to you know we have to look at every last thing, so we are not going to presume that we are allowed to take that time here.","width":627},{"text":"So the short way of saying all of that is leave the decision ","width":607},{"text":"to reassign ","width":384},{"text":"to the client.","width":320},{"text":"so that when they say 'a' equals 'b' they want it to happen and the only time we are not going to let it happen is if it is a destructive maneuver.","width":691},{"text":"Ok.
