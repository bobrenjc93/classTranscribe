Semicolon!","width":64},{"text":"Put it in the curly brace's right spot.","width":256},{"text":"You will get caught by that bug.","width":192},{"text":"Somebody will get caught by that bug and post to Piazza.","width":256},{"text":"OK? It's not unusual.","width":192},{"text":"So I.m gonna save it and then go compile it. Bing! See?","width":384},{"text":"Here just says. Take my history. Look at my history. ","width":320},{"text":"It commands a do the last one that started with a C. Do the last one that started with a C.","width":448},{"text":"And so that invokes Clang++ demo.cpp","width":320},{"text":"Compiler liked it. There were no weird errors.","width":256},{"text":"We can declare a sphere that is vacuous.","width":192},{"text":"It has no data associated with it has no functions associated and it was perfectly fine","width":320},{"text":"Any question about it?","width":128},{"text":"At all? What happens when we go that?","width":384},{"text":"Nothing","width":128},{"text":"Cause all we did was declare something we don't expect to be able to see.","width":256},{"text":"Now, it is true that things did happen in memory,","width":256},{"text":"and that's going to be the substance of the lecture slides today.","width":256},{"text":"but for now we are still in experiential mode.","width":128},{"text":"OK. So now let's go make a sphere class that does some things.","width":256},{"text":"Alright. I didn't think about this part too much.","width":384},{"text":"But I do want to go ahead and...","width":640},{"text":"Tell me the name of that function","width":64},{"text":"Constructor. That's right.","width":192},{"text":"This one has this special more generally called a constructor and I can tell that it is so","width":448},{"text":"because it has the same name as the class name.","width":192},{"text":"The only other function that I'm gonna take the time to instantiate or to declare here is","width":384},{"text":"a getDiameter. And it will return a double, needs nothing","width":640},{"text":"and if you recall, we specify that it had to have a const.","width":512},{"text":"And then we represent our sphere using a radius.","width":192},{"text":"Alright so I think this should be ok.","width":256},{"text":"So let's compile.","width":64},{"text":"First before we compile, we'll do this first.","width":768},{"text":"What happens if you have no constructor. Yeah we'll leave it like that right now.","width":320},{"text":"See... Ok. Syntactically we are in good shape.","width":576},{"text":"Are you surprised by that?","width":640},{"text":"Why are you surprised?","width":256},{"text":"How about this?","width":64},{"text":"What if I now say... double b equals apple.getDiameter?","width":768},{"text":"Now I'm in danger zone. This is true a shared experience","width":960},{"text":"I have to do debug in here","width":64},{"text":"because are especially good when you have shared experiences which is kind of tense ","width":832},{"text":"and you have to deal with and unknown","width":192},{"text":"that's this moment","width":192},{"text":"so raise your hand if you think that the compiler is going to yell at me","width":64},{"text":"raise your hand if you don't think that the compiler is going to yell at me because after all I haven't really changed things very much.","width":448},{"text":"I'm not sure","width":64},{"text":"I hope it yells at me","width":128},{"text":"Did you see what happened here?","width":768},{"text":"The compiler said hey you tried to use getDiameter and there is no getDiameter","width":448},{"text":"It made for me no getDiameter","width":192},{"text":"So the last in here is that you can declare a function without implementing it as long as someone volunteers to finish that sentence","width":640},{"text":"right. you don;t use it. Pretty much period. Pretty much never call it","width":576},{"text":"The way to finish that sentence in a meaningful way is in client code","width":320},{"text":"cause it's another little piece of vocabulary. The code that uses this object is client code","width":384},{"text":"for the moment our only client that we have here is me","width":192},{"text":"Any questions about that? Are you good?","width":192},{"text":"OK. Let's go. So that says oh boy way better implement getDiameter","width":448},{"text":"Let's do that very quickly.","width":192},{"text":"I need to connect getDiameter to this sphere class. It needs to be specified as const","width":896},{"text":"and I've already forgotten my return type here","width":64}]
