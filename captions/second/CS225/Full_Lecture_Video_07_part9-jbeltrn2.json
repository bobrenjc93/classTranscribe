[{"text":" thats called abdication. You abdicated. Was it fun?oh no no one will ever do it again. Ill erase it so youll have it. Okay so while we were doing this somebody asked me a really good question and that was actually there were two questions. Im going to ask them in reverse order. ONe of them was why did he use an arrow on the left side and a point on the right side. period on the right side","width":3392},{"text":"this is a pointer to the current object.Okay it is not the current object. It is a pointer to the current object or the memory address of the current object. In C++ we dont have to write it inside member functinos. SO i get to erase all of this and i dont know what you guys think but i think the code is more readdable the less text that is there. So that is the style that course staff like to read","width":3328},{"text":"Now all that is correct we have to explicity assign all of the member variables. Then we have to do some for loop for int i equals zero, i less than num, atts i plus plus. atts sub i equals orig.atts[i]","width":2880},{"text":"any questions? excellent questions i am glad  you brought it up. Look what he noticed. We have got a function refering accessing a private member of the sphere class. surely that should be forbidden but no because this right here says sphere because we are writing a spere class member function we have direct acces to the private members","width":3328},{"text":"it is worth pointing out that if we are writing a sphere class member function we have direct acces to the private variables","width":1024},{"text":"Any time a parameter is passed by value. that code is invoked. Okay. We are not done. OH shoot i think we have to be done. This is such a bad place for a cliff hanger because we have created new memory and we have no mechanism for cleaning it up.                        SO we are just going to leave ourselves in a mess until firday","width":2688}]
