[{"text":"[Before Lecture]","width":1472},{"text":"Okay!","width":1536},{"text":"Okay, excellent. Any questions for him? I will facilitate discussion. Alright. Thank you very much.","width":1024},{"text":"That is the cheapest applause you're ever going to get. That was good.","width":576},{"text":"Okay, alright, fine. Did anybody have any other speculation they'd like to do on what this function does or any other description they'd like to add to it?","width":640},{"text":"Okay, so what I want to know next is what is printer?","width":320},{"text":"What is printer?","width":192},{"text":"It's a functor? What the heck is that?","width":512},{"text":"That's a new word.","width":64},{"text":"He said it's a functor. I just want to say it a few times because it's just so much fun to say.","width":448},{"text":"Try it!","width":128},{"text":"FUNCTOR!!!!","width":128},{"text":"That's right. Good. Okay, in fact that is correct.","width":448},{"text":"Now, but there is a little bit of ambiguity. I asked the question for a reason.","width":640},{"text":"What does printer look like in the middle of the function there. What does it look like?","width":448},{"text":"It looks like a function, right?","width":128},{"text":"It is applied to some parameter with parenthesis so it looks like a function, but where did it come from?","width":640},{"text":"It came in as an object, right? It came in as a parameter to the function. So, in fact, printer is what we call a function object.","width":1024},{"text":"A.K.A. Say it!","width":576},{"text":"Thank you.","width":64},{"text":"Also know as a functor.","width":256},{"text":"Alright any questions about that?","width":192},{"text":"Alright, fine. Well, all of that is quite abstract, right? All of it is quite abstract. So let's make it a little more in the context of this function.","width":832},{"text":"So let's make it a little bit more concrete.","width":128},{"text":"The question is, how do we make a functor? What is a functor?","width":384},{"text":"Well, take a look at this code right here. Take a look at this code.","width":448},{"text":"What does it do?","width":384},{"text":"Overloads the parenthesis operator, very good. And that is it. That is all it does. It overloads the parenthesis operator to do a little tricky function.","width":1024},{"text":"A little cute function. Okay, fine. Now, but it is a class. So we can declare something of that type.","width":512},{"text":"So the first thing I want you to do is remember the previous example and declare something of type animal.","width":448},{"text":"Anybody want to come up here and do these on my tablet for me?","width":320},{"text":"Okay, fine. How about verbally tell me what to do.","width":256},{"text":"How do I declare something of type animal?","width":192},{"text":"You remember? From last tme.","width":256},{"text":"You know the struct is behind here you can almost see, oh look, look. Right here. You can see it!","width":704},{"text":"Who wants to do this? Raise your hand. Somebody raise your hand.","width":448},{"text":"Okay, close your eyes and raise your hand. Close your eyes. Raise your hand.","width":448},{"text":"Chickens, you bunch of chickens.","width":192},{"text":"Animal c is a chicken.","width":384},{"text":"And if you remember it is a big chicken that eats you.","width":384},{"text":"Okay, so I declared an animal. Now, print if big is a class.","width":384},{"text":"Which means, I can declare something of that type, right? Yes.","width":384},{"text":"I can cover over all of this and it says class print if big. It's not templatized or anything.","width":576},{"text":"So I can say print if big.","width":192}]
