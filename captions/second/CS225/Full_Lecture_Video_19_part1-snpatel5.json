If you actually do it, one point towards your grade.","width":512},{"text":"No, don't even negotiate with me.","width":320},{"text":"Alright, We’ll let you know what the actual incentive is, we probably will send you an email on how to do this and I'll let you know what the incentive is other than the goodwill of the community, come on!
