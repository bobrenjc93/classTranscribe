The answer is yes, our intention is yes. In the past there was this bug, where if you started on 2.2, it messed you up on 2.1, but I think we fixed that.

And then we will fully grade your mp every night between that intermediate deadline and final deadline and moreover, because we recognize if you get  an 85 on the night before it's due, you're gonna scramble to fix it. And in the process, you break it completely. We take the highest of the last two submissions.

Raise your hand if you were in the lab last night on the MP, because I want to talk to you. Was it crowded in the lab last night? Not really? This is a strange phenomenon. In the past, on the night things are due. There are like 80 people on the queue, and the course staff is going out for dinner. And so it really like a fruitless thing  to wait until the last minute, because  if you run into problems, it is very difficult to get help. But last night there were only 3 people and 4 course staff. For those of you who do not know what I am talking about with the queue and the office hours. What you are going to do is go to chara.cs.illinois.edu. And put your name on the queue and the course staff will come find you. Our intention is to staff office hours everyday of the week from 9am-9pm.","width":8235},{"text":"Choose a box, each one of you choose one box to examine carefully with someone sitting next to you, simultaneously while you're working on your one box, I will try to work on all four boxes.
