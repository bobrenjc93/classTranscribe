[{"text":"[Talking about the football game.  Nothing related to the lecture.]","width":5632},{"text":"All right. Should we work? Let's work.","width":192},{"text":"All right. So I have a for loop for you. I have a for loop for you. OK.","width":576},{"text":"What you normally see if this were a for loop like those you had seen before most frequently?   ","width":512},{"text":"What would you see right following the letters F, O, R ? What would you see there? ","width":384},{"text":"An integer right? Integer i = 0, right? That's what for expect. That's what the for function expects to see right?","width":1024},{"text":"It expects to see a type of thing that can be initialized to a start value.","width":384},{"text":"Now. In this instance what we have is not an integer. It's a generalized notion of something that can be incremented. And we refer to it as an iterator.","width":896},{"text":"Okay. If you look at the role that the integer i plays in that place. It is something to use to iterate through some structure right?","width":768},{"text":"It is incremented incremently. Umm...","width":192},{"text":"It is incremented as by virtual for loop. And  that's what you should expect to have happened here for this new type of thing that we happened to be calling an iterator.","width":896},{"text":"OK. All right. So yes. Just as you normally expect to see an int there. In this case we have another kind of thing called an iterator.","width":1024},{"text":"Hold on.I'm gonna make this right.","width":320},{"text":"So this replaces the int kind of thing okay? But it's just an iterator.","width":448},{"text":"All right. Fine. What is IT?","width":192},{"text":"The name of it right? It's like i.","width":256},{"text":"The name we happen to choose . All right.","width":256},{"text":"And in stead of setting it to zero which happens to be rather arbitrary really as our place where we normally start counting. ","width":704},{"text":"We're gonna use this abstract notion of this starting place called begin(). OK?","width":320},{"text":"What normally goes here?","width":576},{"text":"It usually goes like i is less than size or something right?","width":448},{"text":"OK. All right. And so now instead of that, we say okay. ","width":576},{"text":"I'm gonna take this generalized notion up to the end of whatever it is.","width":320},{"text":"So we go from the begin to the end okay?","width":384},{"text":"Uh...","width":64},{"text":"What is this ?What is begin()?","width":320},{"text":"It's a function. Very good. It's a function in our class . Does it dwell?","width":384},{"text":"well list class... The standard template library list class gives us this function  calledd begin().What's begin()'s return types?","width":1152},{"text":"What is  begin()'s return type?","width":320},{"text":"Iterator. Right? It's return type is an iterator. How do I know that?","width":576}]
