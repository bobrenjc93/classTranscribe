[{"text":"I went to see Louis on Tuesday.","width":128},{"text":"Yes. I am sorry.","width":512},{"text":"Yes. That's true.","width":128},{"text":"You had an exam and I went to a concert.","width":64},{"text":"I am sorry. Most of all I'm sorry for Madis because he's really the person who made that possible.","width":384},{"text":"So.. I am gradeful.","width":256},{"text":"For that freedom.. I couldn't have done that last semester.","width":192},{"text":"And yesterday, I went to Chicago.","width":128},{"text":"So I'm just completely screwed up, like mental spacewide. Like what day is today? Tuesday? OK..","width":384},{"text":"Let's play. I don't know.","width":128},{"text":"So I apologize. It's definitely due tonight.","width":192},{"text":"Uh.. The other thing is going on this window of time.. I don't know what window is it exactly..","width":640},{"text":"But you go over the siebel center, it is filled with people.","width":192},{"text":"Most notably alumnus.","width":256},{"text":"So yes. It's all their companies and stuff like that.","width":192},{"text":"But the cool thing for me is that peoplewho were sitting in your seat just a few years ago,","width":448},{"text":"And so they are actually, so yes, they are now doing the recruiting thing when your nervous about talking to them,","width":384},{"text":"but they are just like you.","width":128},{"text":"just a couple years further on.","width":128},{"text":"So be insbired by them, enjoy talking to them,","width":320},{"text":"Don't be nevrous talking to them.","width":128},{"text":"Because we can break the chain of nervousness.","width":128},{"text":"They are really.. let's take it from me..","width":192},{"text":"I have known them and I know you.","width":192},{"text":"They are just like you.","width":64},{"text":"Maybe not even quite as marked.","width":192},{"text":"So.... I am just kidding.","width":192},{"text":"There are millions of definitions of smart.","width":256},{"text":"So when I say that, I don't even know what it mean.","width":192},{"text":"Should I stop talking?","width":64},{"text":"Yes!","width":128},{"text":"Yes! OK!","width":128},{"text":"Last time, we were talking about..","width":256},{"text":"Last time, we were talking about.. a new abstract data type.","width":320},{"text":"called a stack.","width":64},{"text":"We are gonna finish up that discussion today","width":192},{"text":"and also complete discussion of another abstract data type called a queue","width":512},{"text":"So it turns out that stacks and queues are together","width":384},{"text":"in almost every data structure book ever written.","width":256},{"text":"ANd the reason for that is beacause they're both constrained access linear structures.","width":320},{"text":"And a lot of implementation issues that we talked about are the same between the two of them.","width":384},{"text":"What's very different about the two of them are their applications.","width":256},{"text":"As we go on through the semester, you will see applications of each of them will be pretty careful to distinguish one for the other  in those contexts.","width":704},{"text":"Notably mp4 helps you see the differences.","width":256},{"text":"how they work in the context of one application.","width":320},{"text":"Alright. So we were implementing the stack with an array","width":256},{"text":"And I wanted to ask you to revisit that.","width":256},{"text":"I understand that this is completely warm up, and I need a warm up.","width":384},{"text":"Who might not, but I do.","width":128},{"text":"So the stack has the following public interfaces or abstract data type.","width":512},{"text":"Both of those are sort of interchangable in term of expression.","width":256},{"text":"The function push which is a specialized notion of inserting into the structure","width":512},{"text":"and the notion of pop is the specialized notion of removing something from the structure","width":384},{"text":"now. it's a linear structure that the data is all lined up.","width":384},{"text":"In our understanding of that data, not necessarily in memory but","width":384},{"text":"we could sort of think of it as being lined up in memory.","width":256},{"text":"and as such, when we insert and remove from this linear structure.","width":384},{"text":"we are going to take the advanage of this idea of being next to each other.","width":320},{"text":"Specifically, when we push onto the stack, ","width":384},{"text":"when we push onto the stacks, and so pretend a wasn't there","width":192},{"text":"we are going to push onto the stack. The notion of next is generated there.","width":448},{"text":"because the next state after 8, comes the first data element, then, the next state element is 6.","width":512},{"text":"And the next one is 3, and the next one for 3 is oh, i dont know.","width":384},{"text":"nothing. OK?","width":128},{"text":"There is no next one for three. ","width":64},{"text":"Three is the end. So, this idea of the next element, what this creates linearity in the structure in itself","width":576},{"text":"OK, similarly, similarly when we pop from the stack, or when we remove the elemetn from stack, we explict the notion","width":640},{"text":"of next, because standing behind this 8 already ready to take its position","width":320},{"text":"Is a value, just sitting here.","width":192},{"text":"Next value takes its place.","width":128},{"text":"OK? ugh, when 8 is removed. ","width":192},{"text":"Alright, now, for the details, of an array based implementation","width":448},{"text":"you take a look at the private section, the data contained in the private section,","width":320},{"text":"and you see, I am gonna start at the bottom.","width":128},{"text":"What is this?","width":128},{"text":"What is this? not literally, but what does it mean?","width":256},{"text":"It the dynamic array, good, we will talk about that in a second","width":256},{"text":"What is this one? What does it communicate?","width":128}]
