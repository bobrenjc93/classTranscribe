[{"text":"Okay and that is really the only time I feel like it's accurate to say we call the constructor.","width":896},{"text":"Other than just letting the system invoke it for us, okay.","width":283},{"text":"Any questions about that first example so that's the ball class constructor we need to instantiate the name.","width":413},{"text":"But we also need to instantiate the sphere part of it and to do so we invoke the sphere class constructor. Yes?","width":1036},{"text":"So umm, so let me if I got your question correctly. So by invoking that sphere class constructor it's gonna go lay out its memory.","width":652},{"text":"In the way that it wants to, right?","width":175},{"text":"So that's how you get it for the ball class.","width":281},{"text":"Now the ball class might have its own dynamic memory but that would happen inside the ball class constructor, okay?","width":576},{"text":"Does it help?","width":211},{"text":"Yes, on top of, below actually is how I think of it but it might be on top of. I don't know how memory does it. Yes.","width":694},{"text":"Yes yes yes, very good. That was the next thing I was gonna say.","width":235},{"text":"So I explicitly called the no argument constructor of the base class here.","width":380},{"text":"If you don't do it, the system will do it for you.","width":213},{"text":"But that's the only one, that's the only one it will ever do for you.","width":252},{"text":"So if you don't invoke a constructor. The no argument constructor is made for you","width":344},{"text":"But I assert you already knew this.","width":219},{"text":"When did you experience this behavior?","width":277},{"text":"Image class, that's right, this is what is going on in the image class, right? For mp2.","width":331},{"text":"You declare a image and the system says okay i'll make you a PNG with this additonal functionality.","width":481},{"text":"Okay so this happens by default.","width":694},{"text":"Okay and if the system provided one the system provided one will be used if there's a custom one the custom one will be used.","width":505},{"text":"Okay but those are kind of boring constructors. Let's talk about this more sophisticated one that takes not only a name but also a radius.","width":750},{"text":"Okay so here, here we really do want this is the behavior you wish you had for the image class.","width":587},{"text":"It would be nice to be able to invoke the PNG constructor that allows you to give it a size.","width":448},{"text":"But we didn't tell you about this yet.","width":134},{"text":"Alright so all you have to to invoke that sphere class constructor is essentially make a call to it in the intialization line.","width":758},{"text":"Right?","width":103},{"text":"And so object itself then looks like you know the sphere with radius r.","width":608},{"text":"theRadius and its value is r and it has name whose value is n.","width":731},{"text":"Okay any question about that?","width":194},{"text":"Yes?","width":286},{"text":"So the question is can you move it out of the initializaiton line. ","width":345},{"text":"Anytime somebody says can you in c plus plus I'll go oh probably.","width":301},{"text":"But number one I don't know how to and number two the expectation is that it will be there so somebody's looking at your code and you're wondering what constructor you're using. That's where they gonna look for it, if you hack something...","width":832}]
