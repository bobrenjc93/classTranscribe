[{"text":"The name is the only thing missing. ","width":448},{"text":"The type has to be integer, and the value (how do we give it the value as we only have x?)... ","width":576},{"text":"Here's how we give it value. ","width":128},{"text":"We say the value of p equals 42. ","width":448},{"text":"So we know P, you follow the pointer, and you put the value inside. ","width":384},{"text":"In other words, P is a pointer, we ask for a new integer, it has no name but it is a box. ","width":640},{"text":"We assign that one to P.","width":256},{"text":"And then when you do this statement","width":192},{"text":"When you do this, this says go to P, follow the arrow, give it value 42. ","width":320},{"text":"Yes, that's right.","width":448},{"text":"You still have to assign value to it otherwise it is garbage.  ","width":256},{"text":"In fact all constructor rules apply there. ","width":128},{"text":"Alright, yes. ","width":128},{"text":"Possibly, yes. ","width":512},{"text":"And also so the system is going to decide when you are done with P, based on the scoping. ","width":704},{"text":"When you are done using P, when your function execution stops, P is going to be gone. ","width":320},{"text":"This won't be. ","width":128},{"text":"This will persist until you say you're done using it. ","width":128},{"text":"Okay? ","width":128},{"text":"Yes? ","width":128},{"text":"Umm, if I have the right constructors made I can. ","width":384},{"text":"So if I have a sphere class constructor that takes a radius, I put a radius there. ","width":448},{"text":"Okay, are we good? ","width":64},{"text":"I think the best way to get up to speed with this material is just to practice. ","width":256},{"text":"So we're going to spend a few minutes practicing. ","width":256},{"text":"Yes? ","width":64},{"text":"Yes! So I'll say this, because I think it's helpful. ","width":384},{"text":"New is a function. ","width":64},{"text":"In C++. ","width":128},{"text":"It takes an argument.","width":256},{"text":"The int, the type, is the argument to the new function. ","width":192},{"text":"What does new return? ","width":192},{"text":"A something pointer. ","width":384},{"text":"That's right. ","width":64},{"text":"On the left hand side you have to have a pointer. ","width":256},{"text":"On the left hand side of the assignment statement you need a pointer. ","width":192},{"text":"So you know that new will return new a pointer type. ","width":320},{"text":"Oh! Okay, now you're asking for me to keep going. ","width":512},{"text":"Alright, I want to show you something that's very fun in that it's part of your cultural heritage. ","width":576},{"text":"Before we go on though. ","width":256},{"text":"Okay","width":896},{"text":"Much smoother about this this hour","width":384},{"text":"Nope nope no I don't want you ","width":192},{"text":"And","width":512},{"text":"Okay ready? ","width":192},{"text":"Okay. ","width":64},{"text":"Hey Binky, wake up! ","width":192},{"text":"It's time for pointer fun! ","width":128},{"text":"What's that? ","width":64},{"text":"Learn about pointers? Oh goody!","width":256},{"text":"Well to get started, I get we're going to need a couple pointers. ","width":192},{"text":"Okay! ","width":64},{"text":"This code allocates two pointers for integers. ","width":320},{"text":"Okay well I see the two pointers but they don't seem to be pointing to anything. ","width":256},{"text":"That's right! Initially, pointers don't point to anything. ","width":320},{"text":"The things they point to are called pointees. ","width":64},{"text":"The pointees are separate. So how do you allocate a pointee? ","width":448},{"text":"Okay, well this code allocates a new integer pointee, and this part sets X to point to it.
