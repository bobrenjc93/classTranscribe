[{"text":"Um in this current example yep right now if I change s.  If I change s to true here so I have an s dot printed equals true.  And I refer to c out heres c value will be changed.  That is partly what pass by reference gets you.","width":1600},{"text":"Alright any other questions about this?  Alright.  So these are the warnings. Okay.  So we talked about constructors in enough detail to be dangerous.  But when we did so we didnt have a very sophisticated understanding of memory so the kind of objects we made couldn't be very complex.","width":2048},{"text":"Remember that the fundamental role of a constructor is to answer the question, what do you want the object to look like when you declare it, and in this case rather than a sphere with a radius we are going to talk about what we want the object to look like when we have a richer sphere.","width":1664},{"text":"So take a look at this sphere.  We still have the radius.  What do you think this business is?  You can use the diagram on the page as a clue.","width":1088},{"text":"If somebody said hey whats atts?  What type is atts?  How would you describe it?  There are a lot of right answers here.","width":768},{"text":"Yeah its a pointer to a string.  Okay fine.  What else can it be interpreted as? An array that is right. So remember that when you are looking at variables, if you see something that is a pointer it may be initialized to an array rather than just a value.  Okay.","width":1664},{"text":"So and in fact that is what we intend here.  We intend to use that string pointer as an array in our structure.  Okay so let me show you what I would like a default sphere to look like.  And you can help me write the constructor that makes it so.  It is a perfect review of what happened last time or 2 times ago?","width":1728},{"text":"Okay so when I declare sphere A here is what I want it to look like. I want it to have a radius of 2 inches and I want it to have 3 attributes.  I am just going down this list checking them off.  And I want those attributes to be a sequence of strings that are red and juicy and crunchy.","width":1984},{"text":"The default sphere is an apple.  Okay.  Yay!!! Alright.  So how do we make thatn.  Yeah.happe","width":960},{"text":"Do I need an array of arrays?  No because this whole thing is going to be A.  This part is not intended to indicate an array.  This part is just going to be a list of these variables. Okay","width":1152},{"text":"But yeah this yellow part is an array.  That is right.  And we have to use the constructor to make that happen.  I am going to remind you of some syntax here.  So we are going to right this constructor.  I am going to remind you of some syntax.","width":768},{"text":"You can use the initializer list to instantiate some of the variables.  Since we are not using user input here for this default behavior it is pretty safe.  We do not need to do any error checking.  So we can say the radius is 2.0 and more over it is safe to say num atts","width":2496},{"text":"Sorry it is a little weird to say that word.  Num atts is 3 so they would actually be up on the same line.  Initializing this array though would be a little bit more complex.","width":832},{"text":"[continues writing on screen]","width":384}]
