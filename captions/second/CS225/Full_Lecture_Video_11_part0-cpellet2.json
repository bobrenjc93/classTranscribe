[{"text":"OK, alright, let's get started. So guess what's coming up in two weeks? Yes! The exam, very good. But also wait a minute, this is a problem actually, the exam comes first, then we have reflections projections, the coolest student run experience I have ever seen, closely followed by Hack Illinois, which is later. Yeah so we're well represented here. So Jessica and Victoria want to talk to you about opportunities for, um well, to tell you about reflections projections and how you might participate. Hi I'm in Victoria I'm the chair for reflections projections this year. We have a lot of cool speakers coming in this year between the first and the fourth of October. We also have a programming competition so if want to come build an AI we have awesome prizes, including an Oculus Rift in those. So if you want to come compete and try to win that we'd love to have you. It's October 1 through 4. The programming competition is between the second and third. We have a puzzle competition going on over the course of the event. We also have speakers all of Saturday and some scattered throughout the rest of the event. Two job fairs, one is on Thursday, one is the big job fair on Friday. So if you want to come meet recruiters, see speakers, and maybe compete in a programming competition, come to RP. And here's Jessica to tell you how you can get involved and volunteer. So yeah in addition to experience the event itself, we would love it if some of you or all of you would come help us our during the event. So there is a sign up URL for that, it's www-s.acm.illinois.edu/rpvolunteer. Essentially it's the ACM URL slash rpvolunteer, no special cases, no spaces, just rpvolunteer. If you go there and sign up we will get you fitted for a time slot. And if you volunteer you will be fed, you get food. And you get a free t shirt! Who doesn't love free t shirts. Also food is free for the entire weekend. And it's always good food. OK thanks guys, are you coming back for the next hour? OK nice to see you both. Let's work! Seriously, when I go to reflections projections, I walk out of the talks going \"oh I'm so glad I'm with computer scientists.\" It","width":16064},{"text":"It's really inspiring to hear all the huge variety of cool things that people are doing. And the most interesting thing for me is that the speakers tend to be kind of younger, so there's this generation between you and me kind of, and those tend to be the people who come to speak. So I'm always very excited. ","width":1600},{"text":"So I want to work, and so unfortunately I'm going to have to erase all of this. I know, I know, erasing all the fun. There shall be no fun.
