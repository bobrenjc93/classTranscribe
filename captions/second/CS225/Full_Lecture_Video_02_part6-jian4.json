[{"text":"I can't hear, you have to yell. Oh yeah, look at this, look at this. I just said 5 minutes ago, don't touch that, you cannot change the radius. ","width":960},{"text":"And yeah, here we are doing it, here is gonna allows it. ","width":192},{"text":"The fact that this says here allows me access","width":320},{"text":"This is a sphere class member function I have access and I need access to these private members","width":576},{"text":"OK? That's what we were doing here","width":256},{"text":"Yes? No, you cannot do this in a client code","width":320},{"text":"You don't want to do this in the client code","width":128},{"text":"This is all part of the sphere class definition","width":256},{"text":"OK, let's do getDiameter()","width":256},{"text":"I am gonna do this one for you because there is absolutely nothing about this code that will surprise you","width":192},{"text":"You can raise me if you want","width":320},{"text":"return 2 times the radius","width":320},{"text":"OK?","width":192},{"text":"Alright, Any question about that implementation? Yes?","width":320},{"text":"Yea, you don't in C++ yeah","width":576},{"text":"You never have to be object itself if you are coming from java","width":192},{"text":" The object there talking about is implicit. There is a this if it's a pointer to the current object","width":384},{"text":"But we are not talking about pointers yet","width":64},{"text":"OK, one last thing","width":1088},{"text":"What the heck is that const","width":384},{"text":"OK, so, noticed that, getDiameter() has no reason at all to change the radius","width":832},{"text":"Putting a const in that place is a promise that it will not change that radius","width":384},{"text":"So const placed at the end of the function signature is a promise that the private members will not be changed","width":1152},{"text":"by the function","width":384},{"text":"And the reason that's good is now I can hand you the getDiameter() signature and I can ask you to implement. ","width":1024},{"text":"And if you try to be in the furious. I am gonna change her radius to 52 every time. You can't. The complier will not allowed you to do that","width":576},{"text":"So it promises if I am asking for information nothing will be changed about the value of the object","width":640},{"text":"Alright, any questions about it, good?","width":64},{"text":"Did we cover everything there?","width":640},{"text":"Why do I wanna make , excuse me?","width":384},{"text":"OK, so the question is why would you wanna do that","width":256},{"text":"The short answer is you want to ask the compiler to help you to control access every time you can't. ","width":832},{"text":"Because the compiler put the code together before the client every uses it before every excecuted","width":704},{"text":"Before your code is ever executed. So every time you can bring control at compile time you want to do this","width":576},{"text":"Now, you do not want get diameter to change the diameter, that would be a bug. So we are trying to increase our integrity of our code enforced by the compiler, just to make it easier to maintain. To eliminate the potential bugs. ","width":1408}]
