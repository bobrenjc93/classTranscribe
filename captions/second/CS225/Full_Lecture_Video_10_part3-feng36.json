So pretend that in this case I clean this up responsibility. Yeah, pretend I clean that up responsibility before I made it assigned ","width":640},{"text":"So Is that ok?","width":64},{"text":"Yeah, that's fine","width":256},{"text":"The only thing is, so I can make this assig","width":256},{"text":"assignment","width":64},{"text":"but S is still a sphere pointer so I can't get to the name","width":320},{"text":"I can't say S dot name(s.name)","width":128},{"text":"anywhere or s dot getname(s.getname) I can't refer to the ball class member functions","width":384},{"text":"like it still have to use only this sphere class member functions ","width":128},{"text":"but the ball is still there","width":192},{"text":"and b still point to the ball so I can still say b dot getname(b.getname)","width":320},{"text":"for example all right and.. so this is fine","width":384},{"text":"but... s the value of s is sphere as you would expected","width":640},{"text":"s derefer, this mass right here , this mass says this is fine but the value of that dereference of s is sphere","width":704},{"text":"all right. b equal to s, is that ok?","width":256},{"text":"no compiler doesn't allow that","width":192},{"text":"so that's not ok","width":192},{"text":"either","width":64},{"text":"all right","width":128},{"text":"good?","width":64},{"text":"this is just the behavior right? like this is null.. you just got a null with","width":384},{"text":"like the compiler tell you it doesn't like it ok","width":256},{"text":"you probably notice you probably notice that each of the classes has a display function","width":448},{"text":"and so now  I'm going to ask you in which contexts which display goals","width":384},{"text":"now just for this seg of discussion, I implemented display so that they tells us which classes comes from","width":512},{"text":"in each case","width":64},{"text":"so the sphere class just display simply says\"hey, I come from a sphere\"","width":320},{"text":"and the ball class display I came from a ball and nothing else.

I am going to set sphere pointer s","width":448},{"text":"and make it point to something that is of type sphere ok.. so it's just type sphere","width":640},{"text":"it doesn't really matter what this sphere looks like and now I am going to ask for display, what do I get?","width":512},{"text":"sphere good, so the right thing happens. all right.
