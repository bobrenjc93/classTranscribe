[{"text":"List item type, ok?","width":175},{"text":"So LIT there, list item type.","width":251},{"text":"You saw it as class T before.","width":144},{"text":"Alright, any question about that?","width":307},{"text":"Ok. Yes?","width":348},{"text":"Why not?","width":87},{"text":"This is C++ we're speaking here. Ok? So the c++ compiler will look at that struct and go oh I know what a struct is.","width":475},{"text":"It's just a class where everything is public.","width":185},{"text":"It's exactly the same thing and you can put functions in there too.","width":218},{"text":"Guess what? You can even put a private section in there if you wanted to.","width":243},{"text":"You can store dat- I mean you already do store data.","width":174},{"text":"You can put functions. It's exactly like a class, ok?","width":204},{"text":"Why did I do struct? Exactly so that you would ask me that question.","width":377},{"text":"Thank you.","width":142},{"text":"Ok. Yes?","width":353},{"text":"Uhm, oh you tell me. I'll tell you right now that this is a declaration.","width":335},{"text":"So what does it mean when you have a variable declaration?","width":183},{"text":"You've got a type, you've got a name. You might a param- an initialization parameter.","width":294},{"text":"It's just the name of my variable. Ok?","width":166},{"text":"So, you know if I were drawing this out.. here's nln.","width":293},{"text":"It's not a keyword, it could've been frog. Which at that point sounds sort of like a keyword.","width":399},{"text":"Alright, any question about it?","width":133},{"text":"Yes?","width":205},{"text":"Yea.","width":185},{"text":"Excuse me?","width":181},{"text":"Nope. No no no.","width":206},{"text":"Except to keep in mind who you're communicating with.","width":196},{"text":"If people expect a class you should use a class.","width":285},{"text":"If people expect a struct you should use a struct.","width":178},{"text":"That's really it.","width":127},{"text":"Yes?","width":235},{"text":"Yea. Yep.","width":165},{"text":"Alright, uh, or at least mostly so that it is.","width":253},{"text":"I mean maybe it's kind of convenient to not if you're making things with everything public.","width":296},{"text":"It's just, I don't know. It's class where everything's public.","width":250},{"text":"Ok, uhhh. Let's see...","width":240},{"text":"Here's what I want instead.","width":156},{"text":"I don't want this uhhh stack variable nln just sitting here.","width":492},{"text":"Instead I want this.","width":211},{"text":"Write me the line of code that you could use to create this in memory.","width":498},{"text":"Ok? So..","width":186},{"text":"Instead I've got a pointer. Do you want me to give you a name for this?","width":311},{"text":"Ok, call it yum.","width":121},{"text":"I used yum a little this weekend so it's on my mind.","width":578},{"text":"Ok. Anybody want to write it on my tablet?","width":511},{"text":"You can. You want to try?","width":160},{"text":"Oh, mine's terrible too. It's kind of a pain actually.","width":276},{"text":"Sure.","width":417},{"text":"It's fun isn't it?","width":359},{"text":"He say's it's intoxicating.","width":650},{"text":"Good.","width":96},{"text":"Good. Anybody want to comment at all?","width":192},{"text":"","width":148},{"text":"Yea I would be explicit probably the system will infer it but I would be explicit.","width":326},{"text":"So I would've put an int right here. That's all.","width":199},{"text":"Ok?","width":58},{"text":"Alright, any other questions about this? Good job. ","width":150},{"text":"Alright, now why did we do this? Why do we do this?","width":231},{"text":"We're going to admit that... this thing holds on to future ones of these.","width":472},{"text":"Ok? And we're going to consider a unit to be we're going to consider a unit to be the pointer together with the data in a sense.","width":652},{"text":"Together with this last box.","width":177},{"text":"So a unit in our structure is going to be one of these things.","width":327},{"text":"And then notice that that's what we have hanging off here.","width":316},{"text":"It's a pointer to a box.","width":127},{"text":"Ok?","width":54},{"text":"So if we do this. If we make this like this. Then every list node...","width":409},{"text":"is effectively the same.","width":163},{"text":"Ok?","width":93},{"text":"Here it's kind of you, you'd have to you'd have this case where sometimes it's null and sometimes it points to everything else something else.","width":428},{"text":"And so we're not going to do that.","width":105},{"text":"We're going to... uhm, for elegance sake hold on to the first thing via a pointer.","width":457},{"text":"Ok? Now, here's what I want you to do next. I want you to change this in memory into this.","width":607},{"text":"So write the line of code or two lines of code or whatever you need to make yum now instead point to this where this is what yum this is what yum used to be.","width":1042},{"text":"Ok?","width":178},{"text":"It makes sense and you can work with the person sitting next to you to make it happen.","width":384}]
