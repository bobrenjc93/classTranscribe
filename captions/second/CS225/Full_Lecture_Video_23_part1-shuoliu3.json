[{"text":"","width":135},{"text":"The reason that broke before was because if it was equal to NULL, I get a segfault. That's right. OK? ","width":377},{"text":"So I have to check for NULL in that case. Umm...I have to check for NULL anyway in order to protect myself from dereferencing a NULL pointer. And moreover, you know, this things I really want to do","width":1216},{"text":"if it's not NULL, it doesn't make any sense to try to enqueue a chlid when it does not exist. OK? So then, if we continue that execution, it looks like this.","width":384},{"text":"T was not equal to NULL, so we yelled T's data, that's a minus, and then","width":512},{"text":"we enqueue T's left, which is a NULL. I think I will write NULL like this because it looks confusing. OK?","width":704},{"text":"And enqueue T's right, which looks like this.","width":256},{"text":"But no containing the slash, OK? Now do you like that? Do you like it? Now you already don't like it, I know it.","width":768},{"text":"Getting in touch with your inner feeling about this.","width":64},{"text":"Why don't you like it? Somebody who doesn't like it raise their hands.","width":384},{"text":"Why?","width":128},{"text":"What's right exactly? What's the point was putting the NULL on the queue, right?","width":448},{"text":"That feels like a waste of time.","width":64},{"text":"It feels like a waste of time","width":128},{"text":"I'm going to articulate the difference in the code in just a minute.","width":192},{"text":"But I wanna continue this way just to finish the example for those of you who happened not to be here last time.","width":384},{"text":"And then we'll talk about what the alternative code would look like, OK?","width":576},{"text":"What the alternative code would look like.","width":64},{"text":"OK! So I'm enqueueing T's left, enqueuing T's right, and then I iterate.","width":576},{"text":"I moved the next iteration of the while loop","width":64},{"text":"Queue is not empty, so I dequeue. My dequeued value is NULL so I ignore it.","width":512},{"text":"And so the next iteration says dequeue again. Yell the value, enqueue the children.","width":704},{"text":"And just in case you missed it, by convention we enqueue left to right.","width":384},{"text":"OK.","width":64},{"text":"and Then continues","width":192},{"text":"Queue NULL know it's not so we dequeue it's not NULL so we yell its value, enqueue the children.","width":384},{"text":"Oh you hate that! The children...","width":192},{"text":"OK?","width":64},{"text":"Dequeue, Â yells the value, enqueue the children,","width":320},{"text":"And then we","width":320},{"text":"dequeue*4","width":64},{"text":"And we what we end up with is a level order traversal of the example subtree.","width":320},{"text":"OK? Alright.","width":64},{"text":"So let's talk about all those NULLs","width":256},{"text":"Let's have a conversation about nothing.","width":192},{"text":"Raise your hands if you get the reference.","width":384},{"text":"OK. If you don't get the reference, you should go to watch Sci-field, all the old episodes.","width":320},{"text":"Show about nothing, right?","width":320},{"text":"OK","width":64},{"text":"So we need to have a conversation about nothing.","width":256},{"text":"So what's the alternative here? How could we protect against this process of populating our queue with all these NULLs","width":768},{"text":"Yeah?","width":64},{"text":"Right.","width":128},{"text":"So you want me.","width":64},{"text":"I'm gonna put it in red.

Right?","width":896},{"text":"If T right is not equal to NULL, OK","width":448},{"text":"Do you guys remember how I feel if statements. you remember that?","width":262},{"text":"So I don't them right?","width":54},{"text":"Because it increases the number of test cases that I need to make","width":256},{"text":"and I hate writing test cases. you might love it","width":192},{"text":"I hate it","width":128},{"text":"So, if I put these if statements here in addition to what already exists,","width":500},{"text":"then it mean that I have to write a test case for if T left is NULL and T left is not equal to NULL","width":82},{"text":"Similarly, for right. That seems sort of silly to me.","width":256},{"text":"Moreover, in terms of the the running time of this function. Think about what happens as you process it","width":541},{"text":"These two lines of code","width":320},{"text":"First of all, how much time does it take to enqueue something? constant time, right?","width":448},{"text":"it takes constant time","width":128},{"text":"Let's say 4. I don't know for what, but it takes 4","width":320},{"text":"this just adds to that value, say 6 ,right?","width":448},{"text":"Whatever, it adds some constant value to the time it takes to enqueue.","width":256},{"text":"Right? So what ends up being faster, if we add these. If we add these, what ends up being faster in the end.","width":960},{"text":"The...what ends up.. how do we save time.
