[{"text":"I went to st. Louis on Tuesday. Seeing Taylor Swift's concert. Yes i am sorry, yes that is true. You have an exam, I went to a concert. Most of all though, I am sorry to being mad. ","width":1088},{"text":"Because he is really the person who made that possible, so yeah I am grateful.","width":384},{"text":"For that freedom. I could not done this last semester. And yesterday I went to Chicago. So I am just completely screw up.","width":448},{"text":"Like mental's face life.  ","width":128},{"text":"What day is today? Tuesday?","width":128},{"text":"Ok. let us play, I don't know. So I apologize, it definitely due tonight. ","width":512},{"text":"The other thing that is going on in this time is that if you go to the Sieble Center, it is filled with people. ","width":704},{"text":"Most notably are alumni. ","width":320},{"text":"Yes there are companies, stuff like that. But the cool thing for me is that people who were sitting in your seat.","width":448},{"text":"A few years ago, so they are actually doing the recruiting thing.","width":320},{"text":"You may be nervous about talking to them. But they are just like you just a few years ago. ","width":640},{"text":"So being inspired by them, enjoying talking to them. Don't be nervous talking to them.","width":320},{"text":"Because we can break the nervousness. ","width":64},{"text":"They are really, taking for me. I know them, and I know you. ","width":384},{"text":"They are just like you.","width":64},{"text":"Maybe quite not even as smart.","width":192},{"text":"I am just kidding. There are millions of definition of smart.","width":384},{"text":"So when I say that, I don't even know what I mean.","width":192},{"text":"Should I stop talking? yes","width":192},{"text":"Last time, we were talking about a new abstract datatype. ","width":640},{"text":"Called a stack.","width":128},{"text":"We are going to finish that discussion today and also complete a discussion of another abstract datat","width":448},{"text":"called a queue.","width":192},{"text":"So, turns out that, stacks and queue are learned together.","width":448},{"text":"In almost all the data structure textbook. And the reason for that is that they are both constrained linear structure.","width":576},{"text":"And a lot of implementation issue that we are talking about are the same between two of them.","width":384},{"text":"What is very different about two of them is their application","width":256},{"text":"As we go on this semester, we will see applications of each of them and we would be very careful about the distinguish ","width":640},{"text":"one from other other","width":64},{"text":"in those context.","width":64},{"text":"Notably, Mp4 helps you see the difference.","width":256},{"text":"How they works on the context of one application.","width":256},{"text":"We were implementing a stack","width":256},{"text":"with an array","width":64},{"text":"And I want you to just re-visit that. I understand that it is completely warm up","width":448},{"text":"But, I need a warm up","width":192},{"text":"you might not, but I do.","width":128},{"text":"So the stack have the following public interface","width":384},{"text":"or abstract datatype","width":128},{"text":"Both of them are sort of interchangable","width":192},{"text":"expression","width":64},{"text":"The function push is a specialized notion of inserting into this structure. ","width":512},{"text":"And the notion of pop is a specialized notion of removing something from this structure.","width":384},{"text":"Now, it is a linear structure that the data is all lined up.","width":384},{"text":"in our understanding of that data, not necessarily a memory, we can thinks of it being lined up in memory","width":640},{"text":"And as such, when we insert and remove from this linear structure, we are going to take the advantage of the idea ","width":640},{"text":"of the data being next to each other.","width":64},{"text":"Specifically, when we push on to the stack, and pretend A was not there. ","width":640},{"text":"We are going to push it onto the stack","width":128},{"text":"The notion of stack is generated there.","width":256},{"text":"Because the next data after A becomes the first data element  that the next data element is 6","width":640},{"text":"And the next of 6 is three and the next one for three is nothing.","width":320},{"text":"ok, there is no next one for three","width":128},{"text":"three is the end","width":192},{"text":"So this idea of the next element is what create this linearity in this structure.","width":320},{"text":"So similarly, when we pop from the stack, when we remove element from the stack, we explicit the notion of next","width":896},{"text":"Because standing behind this 8, ready to take it place, is a value, just sitting there.","width":320},{"text":"next value takes it. ","width":128},{"text":"when 8 is removed","width":192},{"text":"Now, for the details of a array based implementation, you take a look at the private section.","width":576},{"text":"The data contained in the private section ","width":320},{"text":"And you see I am gonna start at the bottom.","width":64},{"text":"What is this, not literally, but what does it mean. It is a dynamic array, good.","width":576},{"text":"We would talk about that in a second","width":64},{"text":"What is this one, was that communicate?","width":128}]
