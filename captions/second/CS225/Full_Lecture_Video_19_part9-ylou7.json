[{"text":"Yeah, so there are all the Mario games. ","width":384},{"text":"I describe this as the Mario family tree, but it isn't really that. ","width":384},{"text":"It's family is not that big, but this is the set of games as of 2007. ","width":320},{"text":"So I actually don't know what happened after 2007, but I will bet you can tell me what this is. ","width":576},{"text":"You know what this is?","width":128},{"text":"Super galaxy I believe.","width":192},{"text":"Mario galaxy, sorry.","width":256},{"text":"I'm not actually as well birthed as I'm pretending to be here, okey? ","width":256},{"text":"Not as cool as that. But, here is why I love this tree. ","width":512},{"text":"So first of all, raise your hand if in your household, you have had one of the games on this chart. ","width":512},{"text":"Okey, or you have played it, or... yeah. ","width":320},{"text":"So, I'm thinking 90%. ","width":192},{"text":"Tell me what this game is. All way to top.","width":512},{"text":"No, you can't read it, it's donkey con. ","width":448},{"text":"And, donkey com, like was that's for my childhood, right? ","width":512},{"text":"So this thing here connects us in a very unexpected way, right? ","width":320},{"text":"Like it's one of very few things that like spends the ages. ","width":384},{"text":"So I love this cause it connects me to you. ","width":128},{"text":"I also love it because donkey com itself is the substance of a painfully fantastic movie called \"King of com\". ","width":768},{"text":"Did you node? 8.4 user rating I think, I'm not sure. Maybe only 8.2, but. ","width":512},{"text":"A fistful of quarters is the subtitle. ","width":192},{"text":"King of Kong is a documentary about professional donkey kong players. ","width":384},{"text":"And, I say it's painfully fantastic because we know people like this.

","width":448},{"text":"Alright, anyway, what I really know is, what I really know is, if you were making this into an applicaiton, undefined","width":576},{"text":"Into an application on iPhone or Apple whatever. ","width":256},{"text":"That is if you were allowing for electronic navigation and manipulation, how would you configure memory? ","width":512},{"text":"So as to eh... How would you configure memory that is what structure would you use. ","width":320},{"text":"How would you do this so as to store all of these things? ","width":320},{"text":"What would you do? ","width":128},{"text":"If this is the tree, probably were figuring out where are the vertexes and where are the edges. ","width":576},{"text":"What are the vertexes? ","width":192},{"text":"The games themselves, right? And where are the edges? ","width":320},{"text":"Yeah, so I think that instead of, you know serves there edges as they are actually draw, maybe what is really going on here is like this. ","width":768},{"text":"You know, that this is the substructure that will be meaningful to us. ","width":320},{"text":"Okey, so now what I'm asking you is, what is the node look like? ","width":384},{"text":"What does a node in this structure look like? What does game look like? ","width":256},{"text":"It's the same question, right? Games are node, what does it look like? What information does it have? ","width":512}]
