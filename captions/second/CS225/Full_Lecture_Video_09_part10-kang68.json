[{"text":"yeah yeah, this one on the other hand, this one feels a little weird. This one feels weird. Whats weird about it?","width":1280},{"text":"Yeah? Yeah that thing up there expects a sphere right? And we're calling it with a ball. Guess what, whose copy constructor is invoked?","width":960},{"text":"Whose copy constructor is invoked here is the question right? It's passed by value whose copy constructor is invoked? Yeah? Sphere's copy constructor that's right.","width":768},{"text":"And so that means that when the ball is sent to that function, there is only a sphere inside of it, but in this case of course that's fine.","width":704},{"text":"right? Thats fine, there's a sphere, we needed a sphere it's perfectly fine. Alright sooooo, sphere's copy constructor invoked even if its the system provided one. Even if it's the one provided by the system and not our custom one. ","width":1280},{"text":"Okay fine. Here's what I want to know next, I'm gonna declare a base class thing in a derived class thing, can I do that?","width":1536},{"text":"Okay, so which one of these is larger? Which one of these things takes up more memory?","width":128},{"text":"Tell me to stop when I get to the larger one. Yeah okay this one, I don't know if that was ever going to work. Okay. ","width":512},{"text":"So is this assignment okay? The thing on the right hand side is larger than the thing on the left, is that okay?","width":384},{"text":"It does work, it actually works. It works, it compiles and the result is that this thing is kind of sliced off to go here.","width":704},{"text":"Right, so the base class thing can accept on it's right hand side a derived class object, but it's sliced across, this still is a base classed thing. ","width":832},{"text":"So this is okay, but b is still base, but smaller. How about this one, how bout this one? Nope, no way, compiler won't let you do this.","width":1344},{"text":"It says woah woah woah, you didn't give me enough information on the right hand side to create one of these. ","width":512},{"text":"Okay, so the compiler actually does not allow that, disallowed by compiler.","width":704},{"text":"Okay, hey leeroy we'll get to it, we'll talk about it next hour, promise you. ","width":448},{"text":"Okay, the question is what happens here? What happens when we are talking about pointers instead and we'll start there next time.","width":448},{"text":"I want to be the one that tells you ","width":10176}]
