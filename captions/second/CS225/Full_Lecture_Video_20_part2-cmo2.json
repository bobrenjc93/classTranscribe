[{"text":"Therefore, it's like you prove all of them simultaneously.","width":320},{"text":"Now, this whole n minus one thing, the only reason this works is because you prove the base case.","width":448},{"text":"Now have you even those camping cups, where they kind of open up. They're like  inside of other rings. I don't know may not seen it.","width":512},{"text":"Or maybe set up a bunch of dominoes, you have to be able to knock the first one over. That's what the base case does for you.","width":320},{"text":"Now, let me go over a concrete example to illustrate this","width":384},{"text":"Now you may not have known this but if you take the first n odd numbers and add them all together, you actually get n squared.","width":448},{"text":"So next time youre at a party you can tell people this. They'll look at you the way they always do when you talk at parties","width":576},{"text":"Hey we're all geeks here, we're used to this. Right? You go to a party and say yeah, I'm studying CS yeah I;m learning all these theories and these data structures and they look at you","width":640},{"text":"I have this problem with my word processor you know? That's gonna be your life.","width":448},{"text":"Alright so, base case, n = 1 right? This just 1 all by itself, 1 squared is one, so Base case is true. Got it. ","width":768},{"text":"Now what you do is for the induction case, you want to show the P(n) is true but you assume that p of n minus one has already been proven true. What's p of n minus one, you take the n - 1 odd numbers and just assume that they're equal the minus 1 squared","width":1024},{"text":"assume that that worked out, now what do we do? We add the nth odd number to both sides and theres this huge huge cloud of algebra and when the dust settles you got n squared","width":704},{"text":"that's how proof by incuction works","width":256},{"text":"is this making sense? ","width":128},{"text":"I'm not gonna make you reproduce this, but looking at this like okay I get what's going on","width":384},{"text":"are there any questions?","width":128},{"text":"there's a nice geometric proof odd this too if you take a square and you go down the south and east ends keep layering more squares you get a nice geometric proof too. Now the reason why im showing you induction","width":1152},{"text":"is that recursion is actually the same thing.","width":256},{"text":"a recursive function is really just a computational proof by induction","width":320},{"text":"because what you have is just some input","width":192},{"text":"you have two cases, you have a base case, and you ahve a recursive case so when I teach I will often use recursive case and incuctive case interchangeably","width":768},{"text":"beacuse it's really the same thing","width":128},{"text":"right?","width":64},{"text":"so here's a cfunction that can computes n square","width":320},{"text":"it's not very efficient but it uses the same algorithm so this is the base case y is 0 this time if i should have wanted to set n = 1 and returns 1","width":576},{"text":"but then when i return i take n square of n  -1 and just assume that it gives you the right answer, dont think about it too much","width":438},{"text":"and then what are you going to do with that? youre' gonna add the nth odd number to that and that gives you the recursive function","width":448},{"text":"the recursion and proof by induction are really the same thing","width":384},{"text":"now uhhhhh one thing about recursion that you need know that this is about CS culture.","width":576},{"text":"have you heard the story about the little kid who asks his  dad what's holding up the world. the dad says well it's an elephant. so the little kid goes away happy and the day later he's thinking about this and comes back and asks, dad what's holding up the elephant? A Hippopotamus. Oh okay kid goes away this time and hour passes. he comes back and goes so what's holding up the Hippopotamus? a turtle. come on dad whats holding up the turtle, he says son its turtles all the way down.","width":1728},{"text":"okay","width":128},{"text":"if you forget this thing that check for the base case, you're gonna get turles all the way down","width":576},{"text":"youre gonna get an infinite loop","width":64},{"text":"and so you'll hear people talk about this. when they talk about recursions if a recursion goes or if you get an infinite loop or something like that youll hear someone say oh it's turtles all the way down. That's what they mean. That is where it is come from.","width":896},{"text":"","width":64},{"text":"this is really just the same thing to say so what do i dofor my base case , what do i do for my recursion case, the only thing different is you have to tell the computer how to tell the difference","width":640},{"text":"so you have an if statement","width":64},{"text":"Hows this? is this good? is this helpful?","width":320},{"text":"If it's not well too bad","width":256},{"text":"sigh....","width":64},{"text":"alright","width":256},{"text":"uhh","width":64},{"text":"I actually like recursion far far better than for loops and while loops","width":384},{"text":"uh they take a little bit of getting used to but once youre used to them they actually tend to be far more reliable and uh when you take cs421 with me I'll tell you all about that but alright","width":896},{"text":"lets see lets go on","width":64},{"text":"so here's what a recursive function on a tree will look like","width":320},{"text":"so the base case for a tree usually its a null","width":448},{"text":"you wanna know what happens if there is a null tree node coming at uh so youll do your base case here","width":576},{"text":"and the recursive case what will happen is you'll call two recursions one you go down the left side one you'll go down the right side and you'll take the data and youll do something to combine them all together","width":832},{"text":"and that's it, that's really all there is to it","width":448},{"text":"alright lets look at an example now try to think about how would you define the height of a tree?","width":640}]
