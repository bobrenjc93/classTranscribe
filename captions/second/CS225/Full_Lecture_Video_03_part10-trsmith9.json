[{"text":"Its a map. I forgot what it was. I think it is somewhere in Silicon Valley.","width":227},{"text":"Doesn't it look amazingly like a chip.","width":278},{"text":"I was like wow.","width":55},{"text":"Yeah. So heres the thing. Theres a really nice metaphor between you know, your basic neighborhood and memory.","width":968},{"text":"That is particular parts of memory are designed to be used for particular things. ","width":396},{"text":"Now, theres you know the. Lets see the schoolyard. Every community has a school yard. Ever map has a school yard. Right?","width":665},{"text":"Here it is here. You can tell because it looks like a school yard or a prison.","width":337},{"text":"And similarly memory has memory has places where everybody throws the data and maniuplates it. Its very regimented like a school or prison.","width":1265},{"text":"How many times can I use that joke?","width":118},{"text":"Thats my question.","width":35},{"text":"And will it roll off quite so well next hour. Like I do not know.","width":407},{"text":"Okay, so just like a neighborhood has particular locations memory does too.","width":346},{"text":"And just like a neighborhood has places you cannot or should not go so does memory.","width":529},{"text":"The parallel in our world is the seg fault.","width":426},{"text":"The seg fault occurs when you go into a corner of your neighborhood where you do not belong. Where you access memory that does not belong to you.","width":665},{"text":"Okay enough with the metaphor.","width":159},{"text":"You're telling me I'm down. I see I have two minutes.","width":160},{"text":"Pen is in my hand.","width":266},{"text":"Okay.","width":218},{"text":"Oh you're turning over your slides. No.","width":196},{"text":"Alright, so we already dicussed the fact I'm starting on next slide. I am going to do this in minute and a half. Okay.","width":347},{"text":"We already discussed the fact that when I say something like int x equal five. In memory the following thing happens.","width":775},{"text":"A location is chosen for you.","width":234},{"text":"Its name is not. The name of that memory, the address of that memory. Again the metaphor address or map.","width":559},{"text":"The addresss of that memory. I do not care about. I don't care whether the system is using letters or numbers. Thats not the level the of abstraction we care about in this class.","width":732},{"text":"Now 233 probably different.","width":170},{"text":"We do not care.","width":89},{"text":"The name of my variable here is x. I happen to have instantiated it with a value that is five and its type is an integer, which tells the system just how much memory it needs.","width":913},{"text":"Now here's the cool thing.","width":210},{"text":"This thing that happens automatically when I say int x equal five. This thing that happens automatically.","width":596},{"text":"Think about what had to happen.","width":95},{"text":"Memory was looked for.","width":113},{"text":"The variable names were set up.","width":156},{"text":"The value was you know the bits were flipped so that the value is represented, etc.","width":320},{"text":"That was all taken care of for me by whats called stack memory. The system took care of it and it put my variable in stack memory.","width":761},{"text":"It set it up for me. No problem.","width":181},{"text":"I did not have to ask it do so.","width":185},{"text":"Effectively I was asking it to do so just by making the declaration. So this stack memory is system administered.","width":758},{"text":"And the nice part about that is when I am done with that variable, the system will also say, oh look she is done and will clean it all up for me.","width":974},{"text":"Now you don't you wish there was a metaphor that, but it never happens.","width":418},{"text":"Okay, so thats it for today. Stack memory. You love it.","width":274}]
