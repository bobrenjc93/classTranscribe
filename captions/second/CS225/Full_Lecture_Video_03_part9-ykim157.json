We are gonna be fine for this semester.","width":158},{"text":"Wouldn't do another high level view.","width":194},{"text":"So, these circles represent called for a class definition.","width":446},{"text":"So consider a single class. The example that you have is this sphere class at this point.","width":344},{"text":"We've already said that we seperate into a header file.","width":504},{"text":"and an implementation file.","width":454},{"text":"Okay, so the example is sphere.cpp and sphere.h","width":664},{"text":"And the vocabulary we use for that h is interface.","width":506},{"text":"because I can give you a .h file and you know how to use the class.","width":341},{"text":"You don't need the .cpp.","width":110},{"text":"You can get everything you need just from the .h file.","width":175},{"text":"Now, what are all these blue bubbles.","width":150},{"text":"Well I'll tell you.
