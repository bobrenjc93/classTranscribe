How did you check?  What was it that you checked, somebody raise their hand and tell me how they checked, there are a couple right answers here.","width":2409},{"text":"Okay excellent, so taking a quick glance and making sure that the ordering property held, that particular strategy worked because the way that the tree was drawn was good.  Whoever laid out this tree didn't happen to missplace their nodes, which they could have done, so how else could we check?","width":2131},{"text":"Good, so an in order traversal of a binary search tree gives you the elements in order.  If you do an in order traversal of this thing they will be laid out in order.","width":1204},{"text":"That is something that is a tying together of your experience with isOrdered from the lab from last week.","width":552},{"text":" Also it's binary search tree day and it'd be crazy for me to pull up a tree that wasn't a binary search tree.","width":1077},{"text":"Okay so I'm going to insert into that tree a value that is 74's left sub tree.","width":871},{"text":"I want a node there, how many different unique values could I put there?","width":984},{"text":"Raise your hand with the answer... I should be seeing a bunch of bunnies (2).","width":1158},{"text":"Okay, somebody tell me one of them.","width":1241},{"text":"73, okay... and insert... (animation plays).. YAH!  I'm telling you the sound really matters doesn't it?","width":983},{"text":"Okay fine here's another question for you, I want to know how many nodes will be looked at, that is how many bounces will occur in the search for key 40?","width":1152},{"text":"k so I'm going to do a find of 40 and I want to know how many nodes will be looked at.","width":1693},{"text":"Okay, so let's do a find on 40","width":1408}]
