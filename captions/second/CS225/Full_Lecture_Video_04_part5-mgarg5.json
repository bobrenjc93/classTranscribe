[{"text":"Oh, excellent question","width":192},{"text":"Can I answer that question on the next slide?","width":192},{"text":"Ok the question is, what if you dont have an x","width":256},{"text":"But you have an integer pointer, does that summarize your question?","width":320},{"text":"So it turns out that you dont want to always have a stack varibale to have to point to","width":593},{"text":"In fact, in this situation, if you have that stack variable, you know you probably should just use x, all of this indirection, that is just playing","width":640},{"text":"as often as you can, just use x","width":192},{"text":"so what are we doing this for then, what is the deal, and the answer is, we have this other chunk of memory, this other region of ram effectively","width":768},{"text":"this other region of ram called heap memory, and it is memory that you control","width":448},{"text":"that is you control when something is allocated from it, and you control when the memory is given back to the system to use","width":927},{"text":"ok, so stack memory was system controlled, and heap memory is programmatically controlled","width":695},{"text":"ok, now how do we do this","width":448},{"text":"again, I got it set up so we have an integer pointer p, and I wanna ask for a chunk of memory","width":594},{"text":"I'm going to do that by saying p = new int","width":656},{"text":"this is explicitly asking for that integer, yo heap, i need some memory, and the heap hands me back a memory address the size of an integer somewhere and this assignment statement gives that memory address to the value of p","width":1632},{"text":"ok, any question about that? and there is no x in sight, there is no stack variable in sight, and in fact,","width":598},{"text":"we dont generally have a name for this, the name of this is really asterisk p, or the dereference of p, the target of p, yes?","width":1073},{"text":"It creates a new one, it creates new space on the heap","width":458},{"text":"Ok? It asks","width":211},{"text":"So p is, when you declare it, it sets it upon the stack","width":509},{"text":"And then you can use it, you can use that spot on the stack as much as you want","width":716},{"text":"Right here? This assignment? Are you talking about the b24?","width":413},{"text":"Show me what you're talking about, ok so p = new int","width":256},{"text":"Yup","width":323},{"text":"It will go to p's spot, because p is on the left hand side, does that make sense? OK","width":512},{"text":"It is not scary to ask a question because I might ask you to","width":320},{"text":"Yes, very good, yes, I can say sphere * s","width":487},{"text":"s = new sphere","width":192},{"text":"And the sphere constructor is invoked, but in this other space","width":529},{"text":"Then i've got an s, and this thing is gonna point to whatever thing that is","width":336},{"text":"Any question about it?","width":128}]
