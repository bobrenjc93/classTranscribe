[{"text":"Wait a minute, so she said this, and I can argue combinatorially this, right?","width":704},{"text":"You see that I can argue this combina","width":192},{"text":"You see that I can argue this combinatorially? The total number of nodes in the tree is all the nodes in the left subtree plus all the nodes in the right subtree, oh and they're the same, plus the root, yes?","width":896},{"text":"Ok. What is this thing right here? How do you describe it? What is it? The recurrence. This is the recurrence.","width":640},{"text":"Are these two different things? Same! They're different expressions for the same idea. Different expressions for the same thing. Oh yeah? Prove it. How would you prove it?","width":1094},{"text":"Using induction. Ok? That discussion we just had there, that discussion we just had there was the total conversation, ok? Like dinner conversation, right?","width":704},{"text":"Do we have it a recursion, recurrence, which is easy to write down. And hypothesized solution, and in order to make agreement between the two, we could do arduous arithmetic like you did when you took calc 1, or we can simply prove that they're the same inductively.","width":1536},{"text":"We're not gonna do it here, but I just wanted to bring that up in this moment, ok? Any question about it? We're gonna do an inductive proof today, just not here. This one's almost too trivial. Oh, sorry.","width":716},{"text":"This should've come from discrete math. Alright, any question about it.","width":461},{"text":"K. So, prove these two are the same.","width":448},{"text":"via induction. And, I'll warn you you know what? I didn't really, I didn't really check this. Is it h plus 1 here, or is it just h?","width":832},{"text":"Ok. Alright, fine. The other way you can prove it is by asking the class.","width":384},{"text":"Alright, any questions about it? Alright. Got another one for you. Let's talk about a complete binary tree.","width":512},{"text":"I'm just shaking my head. I'm just shaking my head. Because if you read that English definition, it stinks.","width":896},{"text":"It's not a recursive, it doesn't evoke recursiveness. It's, I mean listen to this, it's like a perfect binary tree except not all the nodes on the bottom level are there. And moreover, the nodes that are there, they're all pushed to the left. The heck.","width":1328},{"text":"The heck, what kind of definition is that? Well it turns out to be extremely useful to us and so we're going to pursue. we're gonna actually pursue, making an elegant definition of it, but before we do so, I wanna make sure that you could draw a picture of a complete binary tree, so please very quickly, draw me a complete binary tree with one more node than I have 7,8,9,10,11,12.. thirteen nodes.","width":2240},{"text":"Complete binary tree of thirteen node, and you shouldn't start from scratch.","width":384},{"text":"Yeah. Right. Look, this is complete binary tree 12 nodes. Where does that 13th one have to go?","width":896},{"text":"It has to go right here, right? It has to go here. Otherwise, you either mess up the height I believe bunch of different levels, or you add a vertex of the, you don't have everything pushed to the left. Cuz there's really only one place that thirteenth node can go. And I'll put it in here really quickly like this.","width":1792},{"text":"Okay. Any question about that? Alright, fine. Now, because we like recurrence, recursive definition so much, we're going to solve the puzzle of expressing this kind of tree recursively. In this definition, you can use ahh.. your definition for a perfect tree as well.","width":1728},{"text":"Okay? And what I want you to do is figure out what this definition looks like. My hint here, my hint here is to use the example to craft one of the cases. ","width":1408},{"text":"And to think what would happen if this were a tree with ten nodes for the other case, the other piece of the definition. This part.","width":832},{"text":"Okay? And go ahead and spend couple minutes coming up with definition, please","width":448},{"text":"The recursive case.","width":320}]
