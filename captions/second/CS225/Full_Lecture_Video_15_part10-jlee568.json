[{"text":"Here is my hint. This is n. ","width":209},{"text":"And effectively, if you count, you're counting the number of times you can take n and divide it by half. How do you express that yea?","width":683},{"text":"Log based 2^n. Log is basically log b and number of times you can divide by b. That is the piece that should be internal. It turns out that this is.","width":1199},{"text":"Oh, Log based 2 of n there is this minus one. We're not doing this in a row. Not counting it for the last row. Ok!","width":1359},{"text":"Here let me ask you this. K equals 0 to 2 to the n equals what? I'll make this a T to make it less confusing.","width":856},{"text":"Whats that back pocket sum?","width":264},{"text":"It is 2 to the t plus one minus 1 divided by 2 to the minus one. ","width":832},{"text":"Two to the log based n two of n minus 1 over one. Or N minus one good. ","width":738},{"text":"N minus one copying. N minus one additional work. So how does this scheme do on a sequence of n pushes?","width":736},{"text":"It incurs big O of n work or n pushes or big O of 1 per push. ","width":796},{"text":"So on average, the additional work is just a little bit. Just a constant. OK? Alright I'll see you friday. ","width":1752}]
