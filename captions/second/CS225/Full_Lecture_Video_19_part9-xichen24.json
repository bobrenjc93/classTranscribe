[{"text":"Ya, so these are all the Mario games. I said I described this as the Mario family tree but this isn't really that.","width":768},{"text":"Family is not that big. But there are... this is the set of games as 2007 so I actually do not know what happened after 2007","width":704},{"text":"But all that you can tell me what this is. You know what this is? Super Galaxy I believe.","width":512},{"text":"Mario Galaxy, sorry. I am not actually as well versed as I am pretending to be here, OK?","width":448},{"text":"Not as cool as that. But, here is why I love this tree. First of all, raise your hand if in your household you have one of these games on this tree.","width":1024},{"text":"I am thinking of ninety percent? Tell me what this game is. All the way of the top, no you can not read it. It is donkey kong. ","width":1344},{"text":"And donkey kong like was from my childhood, right? So this thing here connects us in a very unexpected way.","width":1024},{"text":"Right? Like it's one of very few things that like spends the ages so I love this cause it connects me to you.","width":576},{"text":"I also love this because donkey kong itself is the substance of a painfully fantastic movie.","width":576},{"text":"Called king of kong. Did you know 8.4 user rating I think I am not sure. May be only 8.2.","width":832},{"text":"But it is full of quarters. It is this subtitle, king of kong. It is a documentary about professional donkey kong clears.","width":384},{"text":"And I say it is painfully fantastic because we know people like this. We might even be.","width":1216},{"text":"Some of us probably are people like this. So anyway, that is my recommendation for Friday night. ","width":512},{"text":"Maybe we should skirmish in Siebel or here. We could skirmish here to get permission.","width":576},{"text":"All right. Anyway what I really want to know is if you were making this into an application. ","width":640},{"text":"An application, an iphone app or whatever. That is pure allowing for electronic navigation and manipulation.","width":384},{"text":"How would you configure memory? So as to... How would you configure memory that is what structures would you use, how would you do this? ","width":768},{"text":"So as to store all of the things, what would you do?","width":576},{"text":"If this is a tree, probably worth figuring out where are the vertexes and where are the edges.","width":192},{"text":"Where are the vertexes? The games themselves right? And where are the edges?","width":768},{"text":"Yeah, so I think that instead of insert these edges that they are actually drawn.","width":384},{"text":"Maybe what is really going on here is like this. You know this is the substructure that would be meaningful to us.","width":576},{"text":"So now what I am asking you is that what is the node look like?","width":320},{"text":"","width":14816},{"text":"What does a node in this structure look like? What does the game look like? It is the same question, right?","width":15203},{"text":"Games are nodes. What does it look like? What information does it have?","width":512}]
