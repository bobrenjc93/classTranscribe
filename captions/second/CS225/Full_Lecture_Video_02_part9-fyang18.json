[{"text":"Are we or could we explicitly call?","width":402},{"text":"Okay so any time anybody ever asks a question in c++ that starts with 'can we', the answer if it fits the specification of the language is yes.","width":978},{"text":"But the more important question is because you can do crazy things with c++, you can hack to your heart's content.","width":512},{"text":"But the more appropriate question is should we?","width":330},{"text":"And so I'm gonna rephrase your question as 'should we explicitly call the constructor' and my answer is in most cases no.","width":832},{"text":"We should not explicitly call the constructor we have define it for the system to use we're going to let it use it, okay? ","width":663},{"text":"Yes","width":286},{"text":"Okay so I'm gonna get there for just a second. ","width":142},{"text":"So that him asking that question is really saying alright move on and I will do so. So let's move on.","width":466},{"text":"Because we have this other constructor and I've just been kind of obfuscating it right, moving past it.","width":481},{"text":"Here's what it allows you to do. And you can tell me at the end if I don't really answer your question, okay?","width":320},{"text":"Umm here is what it allows you to do. It allows you to declare a I don't know what aball is, apple ball? I don't know how big are they, 4.7 something?","width":952},{"text":"It allows you to upon declaration give a value to the radius and the only reason that this constructor exist is because we declared it because we said it should.","width":834},{"text":"Now what does the code look like here? It looks like theRadius equals r.","width":663},{"text":"And we could say if r is grater than 0 do that, else theRadius equals 1.0, say.","width":803},{"text":"Okay? Alright any questions about that?","width":210},{"text":"Yes","width":379},{"text":"Very good question. The question is can we use the initializer list for this constructor the answer is yes and that syntax looks exactly looks like you would expect.","width":809},{"text":"That syntax, I'm gonna put it in a different color ink because it's alternative code, OHHHH, would look like theRadius and have an r in it.","width":892},{"text":"Okay you can refer to the parameters in that initialization list. Why wouldn't you wanna do that?","width":485},{"text":"You cant error correct it. That's right. You still have a question? Yeah okay.","width":450},{"text":"Errrrrr I don't know the answer to that. I think not. I haven't see it.","width":321},{"text":"Is it time to go is that why you're restless. It's not I have two minutes left!","width":285},{"text":"Okay so here's what I'm gonna say in those last two minutes.","width":448},{"text":"If you don't declare any of these, declare or define any of these constructors, the system will give you one. Okay?","width":510},{"text":"So that is point one about constructors.","width":252},{"text":"If you do not provide a constructor, the system will give you a no argument constructor so you can't do this little trick of instantiating the variable without defining yourself.","width":1280},{"text":"A no arg, okay? Now if you give one, if you give one constructor, the system will give you none.","width":666},{"text":"So if we just defined that constructor then and not any other ones we would not be allowed to that declaration, okay?","width":735},{"text":"So ahhhhhhhh, if you define any constructor, the system gives none.","width":1184},{"text":"Okay? And then the last important about constructor I've already made and that is to reinforce the idea that the constructor is a function that you write for the system to use.","width":789},{"text":"And you should think very carefully about why you're explicitly invoking it if you are ever tempted to do so.","width":547},{"text":"So the ctor is written for the system to use upon declaration.","width":1230},{"text":"You should not call it. ","width":384},{"text":"It is not called by client code.","width":448},{"text":"Okay that's it how far did I get in the slides? Look at that. Oh um.","width":192},{"text":"","width":64},{"text":"Okay and that's it how far do I get in the slide. Oh look at that. Whooo, er.","width":1743},{"text":"[interesting noises]","width":320}]
