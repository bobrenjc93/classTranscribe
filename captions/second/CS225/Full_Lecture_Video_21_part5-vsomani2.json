that?","width":64},{"text":"I can argue this combinatorioally ","width":128},{"text":"The total number of nodes in the tree","width":192},{"text":"is all the nodes in the left subtree ","width":256},{"text":"plus all the nodes in the right subtree","width":192},{"text":"oh and they are the same","width":192},{"text":"plus the root","width":64},{"text":"yes?","width":64},{"text":"ok","width":64},{"text":"what is this thing right here?","width":192},{"text":"How do you describe it?","width":128},{"text":"What is it?","width":64},{"text":"The recurrence?","width":128},{"text":"This is a recurrence","width":192},{"text":"are these two different?","width":128},{"text":"things","width":861},{"text":"same","width":128},{"text":"they are different expressions for the same idea","width":192},{"text":"different expressions for the same thing","width":192},{"text":"oh yeah","width":128},{"text":"prove it","width":64},{"text":"how would you prove it","width":128},{"text":"using induction","width":192},{"text":"That discussion that we just had there","width":128},{"text":"was a total conversion","width":192},{"text":"like dinner conversation","width":192},{"text":"We have a recurrsion recurrence which is easy to write down","width":384},{"text":"and a hypothesized solution and in order to","width":320},{"text":"make agreement between the two we could do ardous arithmetic","width":512},{"text":"like you did when you took calc 1","width":128},{"text":"or we can simply prove that they are the same inductively","width":192},{"text":"we are not gonna do it here","width":192},{"text":"but i just wanted to bring that in this moment","width":64},{"text":"ok any question about it>?","width":128},{"text":"We are going to do an inductive proof today just not here","width":320},{"text":"this ones almost too trivial","width":64},{"text":"this should have come from the discrete math","width":384},{"text":"alright any questions about it?","width":192},{"text":"k so, prove these two are the same","width":64},{"text":"via induction","width":576},{"text":"and i'll warn you i didn't really check this","width":384},{"text":"is it h+1 here or is it just h","width":320},{"text":"ok alright fine","width":64},{"text":"the other way you can prove it is by asking the class","width":320},{"text":"any questions?","width":128},{"text":"got another one for you","width":192},{"text":"lets talk about a complete binary tree","width":128},{"text":"shakin my head, shaking my head","width":704},{"text":"i'm shaking my head ","width":128},{"text":"if you read that english definition, it stinks","width":128},{"text":"it's not recursive, it doesn't evoke recursiveness","width":192},{"text":"i mean listen to this","width":192},{"text":"it's like a perfect binary tree except not all the nodes on are the bottom level there","width":512},{"text":"and moreover","width":64},{"text":"the nodes that are there","width":128},{"text":"they're all pushed to the left","width":128},{"text":"the heck?","width":64},{"text":"the heck","width":192},{"text":"what kind of definition is that","width":64},{"text":"well it turns out","width":64},{"text":"it's extremely usefull to us","width":192},{"text":"and so we're going to pursue","width":192},{"text":"so we're going to actually pursue making an elegant definition of it","width":256},{"text":"but before we do so","width":64},{"text":"I wanna make sure that you could draw a picture of a complete binary tree","width":320},{"text":"so please very quickly draw me a complete binary tree with one more node than i have 7,8,9,10 than i have","width":768},{"text":"13 nodes","width":64},{"text":"and you shouldn't start from scratch","width":576},{"text":"yeaah","width":256},{"text":"right","width":64},{"text":"look","width":128},{"text":"this is a complete binary tree with 12 nodes","width":128},{"text":"where did that 13th one have to go?","width":256},{"text":"it has to go right here right?","width":256},{"text":"it has to go here","width":128},{"text":"otherwise you either mess up the height","width":256},{"text":"either mess up the height","width":128},{"text":"so you have leaves on a bunch of different levels","width":64},{"text":"or","width":64},{"text":"you add a vertex so that you that you don't have everything pushed to the left","width":320},{"text":"there is really only one place where that 13th node can go","width":256},{"text":"and i'll put in here really quickly like this","width":384},{"text":"ok","width":64},{"text":"any question about that?","width":128},{"text":"alright","width":128},{"text":"fine","width":64},{"text":"now","width":64},{"text":"because we like recursive definitions so much","width":256},{"text":"we are going to solve the puzzle of expressing this kind of tree recursively","width":576},{"text":"in this definition you can use","width":256},{"text":"uhh your definition for a perfect tree","width":192},{"text":"as well","width":64},{"text":"ok","width":512},{"text":"and what you want you to do","width":64},{"text":"is","width":64},{"text":"figure out what this definition looks likew","width":192},{"text":"my hint here my hint here is to use the example","width":448},{"text":"to craft one of the cases","width":192},{"text":"and to think what would happen if","width":256},{"text":"this were a, a tree with 10 nodes","width":256},{"text":"for the other case","width":64},{"text":"the other piece","width":64},{"text":"of the definition","width":128},{"text":"this part","width":64},{"text":"k","width":64},{"text":"and go ahead spend a couple of minutes coming up with this definiton","width":320},{"text":"the recursive case","width":320}]
