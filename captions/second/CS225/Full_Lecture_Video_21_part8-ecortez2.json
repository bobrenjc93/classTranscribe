[{"text":"Is the example a complete tree?","width":192},{"text":"Yes it's complete that's what we're talking about. is it full?","width":302},{"text":"No, okay because of this guy so no","width":256},{"text":"Every complete tree is not full","width":320},{"text":"Here's one, that one's complete but not full","width":448},{"text":"There's one if I erase all of that","width":128},{"text":"Okay, Alright any questions. So now you have working definitions of ","width":399},{"text":"Full and perfect and complete","width":249},{"text":"If I were you I would make flashcards maybe, I don't know, I know I wouldn't because I would be too disorganized, but you know","width":448},{"text":"Alright, so let's touch base for a second with what um Maddix showed you uh last time about implementation of this structure","width":721},{"text":"So I believe he did something like I believe he did something like create a tree","width":384},{"text":"Uh he might have called it binary tree","width":128},{"text":"Uh but, it had an internal structure that we called a node","width":384},{"text":"Notice just for a second , step back and look at this. Where have you seen something like this before","width":448},{"text":"Besides Friday, where have you seen something like this before","width":263},{"text":"A doubly linked list, right, previous, next who cares what they're called","width":296},{"text":"The structure is the same, the only thing that's different is how we link things up","width":448},{"text":"How we connect things","width":128},{"text":"Okay, um so, uh, Maddix gave me his slides where he had hooked things up","width":512},{"text":"Kinda like his, kinda like this, is this tree full?","width":384},{"text":"Perfect? Complete? Yes okay alright fine","width":384},{"text":"And I looked at his drawing and I got all worried","width":320},{"text":"I was worried that there were too many null pointers","width":448},{"text":"Because we're implementing this thing in such a way that all of the term, all the leaves","width":341},{"text":"All of the terminating nodes have null pointers associated with them","width":359},{"text":"Now, this is kind of fine if there aren't too many of them","width":297},{"text":"How many null pointers would be","width":232},{"text":"Well, first of all let me start with a doubly linked list","width":128},{"text":"Why was I not worried about this at all in a doubly linkedlist","width":256},{"text":"How many null pointers did we have essentially?","width":192},{"text":"Essentially two right? If we, yeah ","width":256},{"text":"Right, essentially two, one at each end okay","width":236},{"text":"So, we had a constant number okay","width":256},{"text":"How many null pointers would make me upset","width":256},{"text":"How many null pointers would make me go \"oh that is too much memory\"","width":320},{"text":"We're using too much memory for n-data items","width":320},{"text":"Exponentially would be too many, two to the n would be too many, how many uh anything else?","width":576},{"text":"Would log(n) be too many?","width":320},{"text":"No? not bad at all because that's fewer than n right?","width":392},{"text":"Log(n) smaller than n, it lives in the world smaller than n. ","width":256},{"text":"And all that means is that every piece of data is just a little bit fatter","width":384},{"text":"Right it has a little bit more actually dwindling amount more","width":320},{"text":"Of stuff, memory associated with it.","width":192},{"text":"So log(n) wouldn't bother us at all","width":128},{"text":"How about linear? A linear number of pointers. Would that bother us? ","width":449},{"text":"On the edge right? ","width":420},{"text":"It doesn't , a linear number of pointers some constant factor of n number of null pointers would not bother us","width":704},{"text":"Because again, it just means we got some overhead associated with our data","width":273},{"text":"We're just a little less efficient ","width":122},{"text":"Representing the integer contained in the data node ","width":320},{"text":"Okay So, no big deal to have a linear number","width":256},{"text":"How about a quadratic number of null pointers","width":320},{"text":"Quadratic number of null pointers , yeah that's bad","width":448},{"text":"I have a little picture for that, what that would mean is that our ","width":384},{"text":"What that would mean if we had n pieces of data","width":448},{"text":"Then we would have this much memory associated just with the null pointers","width":474},{"text":"Right, that's too much. Right n squared of nothing so as a support linear of data that's bad","width":664},{"text":"Alright fine, I want you to complete that theorem for me","width":448},{"text":"as accurately as you can","width":512}]
