Ok","width":172},{"text":"[Video playing]","width":234},{"text":"And just return the data right?","width":93},{"text":"[Video Playing]","width":665},{"text":"What are we going to return now?","width":92},{"text":"[Video Playing]","width":844},{"text":"Never type something twice if you can avoid it","width":140},{"text":"Cut and paste and then modify it","width":179},{"text":"[Video Playing]","width":250},{"text":"Alright, lets see if this thing works now.","width":205},{"text":"[Video Playing]","width":232},{"text":"So we have this population. So this was a minus two,  this was a minus one","width":314},{"text":"This a two, this is a one, this a minus one this is a six and a eight","width":523},{"text":"[Video Playing]","width":305},{"text":"And so what we want to do is we populate, we calculate it's height and then we'll calc it","width":283},{"text":"[Video Playing] ","width":970},{"text":"Alright it said forty-two","width":105},{"text":"So the code's right even if the math might not be","width":263},{"text":"Let's bring that back up","width":168},{"text":"So any questions on this code? Does everyone get this?","width":348},{"text":"[Video Playing]","width":260},{"text":"Is there any other fun thing with a tree you might want to see recursively? Anyone want to see an example?","width":405},{"text":"[Video Playing]","width":477},{"text":"Don't worry tree functions will get a little more complicated later on","width":231},{"text":"What's gonna come next is something called a binary search tree","width":326},{"text":"Where there's a lot more constraints. Right now we just have these nodes and the top nodes connected to the bottom nodes","width":375},{"text":"So the recursions tend to be a little simple cause we don't have to worry, we're just traversing","width":465},{"text":"[Video Playing]","width":226},{"text":"Alright, last call. Any questions?","width":140},{"text":"[Video playing]","width":176},{"text":"Do you feel like you could write this now?","width":215},{"text":"Ok good ","width":76},{"text":"[Video playing]","width":109},{"text":"Alright, so there's one really interesting recursion","width":295},{"text":"Looks kinda like this","width":147},{"text":"You have three lines, you print the node and then you preorder the left, you preorder the right and you really should have an if in there to check if it's null but im just showing you the outline","width":707}]
