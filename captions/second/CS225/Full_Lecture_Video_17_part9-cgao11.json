[{"text":"comments","width":64},{"text":"                                              i can resize the array right?","width":448},{"text":"then what should i do?","width":128},{"text":"why not?","width":156},{"text":"cuz I could dequeue all of this and resize the puppy to one day element ","width":273},{"text":"right? so","width":108},{"text":"resizing is what we want to do here","width":110},{"text":"what you wanna observe is the look it","width":99},{"text":"theres all the empty space over here","width":124},{"text":"there is all the empty space in the front of the array","width":168},{"text":"and so effectively what you are gonna do is wrapping the array around, if you are gonna wrap the array around","width":503},{"text":"and move entry to its new spot","width":328},{"text":"okay","width":41},{"text":"and I'll make it a double way to kind of see","width":325},{"text":"okay","width":48},{"text":"any questions about it?","width":62},{"text":"and how do I do that functionally?","width":140},{"text":"mod is your friend","width":121},{"text":"the mod operator is your friend ","width":167},{"text":"here","width":42},{"text":"okay","width":24},{"text":"yeah?","width":148},{"text":"oh very good. So just a second. Let's get there.","width":235},{"text":"Okay. So is it clear where we are here and then I'm gonna dequeue that moves this guy down here and then I'm gonna enqueue nine","width":576},{"text":"nine goes here and in fact what we end up with is this","width":281},{"text":"okay","width":64},{"text":"I think","width":94},{"text":"entry's on the top. This thing should be on the botton","width":256},{"text":"okay","width":332},{"text":"alright. Any questions about it? Yeah? ","width":318},{"text":"You can figure out where entry goes by taking incrementing it mod tablefies and it will always just put it in the right place","width":589},{"text":"okay yeah so in fact in my code, my index is a mod index.","width":401},{"text":"So I know that I will never go outside of the bounds of that array because I'm always going to take mod the array size. Okay","width":576},{"text":"Alright! So lets do this a little bit more. Any questions about it so far? Yeah?","width":320},{"text":"un-huh","width":437},{"text":"un-huh","width":265},{"text":"I'm not quite with you yet. okay?","width":180},{"text":"Hold on just a sec. I wanna just get us there for a sec","width":190},{"text":"okay","width":64},{"text":"so you guys are really bothered by the fact that we are kind of screwing up where the start of the array is. Okay?","width":384},{"text":"Alright! Fine. Let's do a couple more enqueue y, moves this, enqueue i, moves it again, enqueue s, moves it again.","width":896},{"text":"right? so now entry is here, exit is here. so that becomes a task when you enqueue right?","width":640},{"text":"Are they in the same spot? Has there been data, is there data in the array and are they in the same spot?","width":512},{"text":"then you can argue that the array is full. Okay? Alright! and of course, the next thing is dequeue so that doesn't actually happen at that moment ","width":576},{"text":"but happen in a couple more a bit. We are going to keep going okay? Alright!","width":266},{"text":"So. What are you gonna do? I've got this sort of gap here","width":561},{"text":"I got this sort of gap between what's in the start and what's in the rear","width":1006},{"text":"what should I do? ","width":296},{"text":"I'll give you a hint. The hard answer, the complex answer, the one that makes you go like huh?","width":434},{"text":"is not the right one","width":128},{"text":"I know haha right?","width":128},{"text":"I would set a.. okay, well, lets fix this first and then I'll tell you my stories , so let's see","width":832},{"text":"okay. Alright! so all you do is totally easy. All you do is you just reset. ","width":246},{"text":"you take the exit an you put it here","width":229},{"text":"and you increment. Exit increment forward size number of things, items, sub, you know, k ","width":768},{"text":"where k is in the element of exit up to entry mod table size ","width":749},{"text":"and those go in the position 0, 1, 2, 3 up to k capacity. those go up to capacity minus one","width":1033},{"text":"okay. Does that make sense? So don't worry about like Oh there's yeah. there are overlapping here and just start over.","width":448},{"text":"give yourself a clean slate feels great","width":146},{"text":"Alright! Any questions about it?","width":128},{"text":"is it good?","width":80},{"text":"I'll tell you my stories some other times, it's cute.","width":159},{"text":"Alright that's all I have. Look at that we did it. Yay!","width":320}]
