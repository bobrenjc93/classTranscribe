Sorry, I'm not actually as well versed as I'm pretending to be here.","width":448},{"text":"Not as cool as that. Uhmm, but here's why.","width":448},{"text":"Here's why I love this tree.","width":64},{"text":"This is why I love... So, First of all raise your hand if in your household you have had a one of the games on this chart?","width":512},{"text":"Ok. Or you have played it?","width":256},{"text":"Or... yeah so I'm thinking 90%?","width":256},{"text":"Tell me what this game is?","width":448},{"text":"All the way to the top.","width":192},{"text":"No you can't read it. It's Donkey Kong!","width":256},{"text":"And Donkey Kong like was, that's from my childhood, right?","width":576},{"text":"So this thing here connects way in a very unexpected way, right?","width":448},{"text":"Like it's one of the very few things that like spans the ages.","width":256},{"text":"And, so, I love this because it connects me to you.","width":256},{"text":"I also love it because Donkey Kong itself is the substance of a painfully fantastic movie called King of Kong.","width":640},{"text":"Did you not a point for user rating, it think?
