[{"text":"And then we place the new data element in","width":192},{"text":"and now, here's the beautiful moment.","width":256},{"text":"Look at this. Look at how much keys we have bought ourselves.","width":320},{"text":"We don't have to worry about new data.","width":256},{"text":"We don't have to worry about new data arriving for this long.","width":256},{"text":"That's a super long time right? In fact, it's almost as much data as we already had in the limit.","width":512},{"text":"We are effectively buying our selves relaxation in proportion to this stressful copying, okay?","width":640},{"text":"Does it make sense to you? You know what I'm saying there?","width":192},{"text":"You know..bring it on, bring more data. I got no problem. I got space for a really long time.","width":448},{"text":"Questions about it?","width":128},{"text":"Yeah? I'm gonna address that in just a minute okay?","width":448},{"text":"Iâ€˜m gonna address that. I have a whole slide about it.","width":128},{"text":"Alright, we're specifically talking about an array, and how we're using an array here.","width":448},{"text":"Okay, so think about what this means.","width":256},{"text":"It means that, umm, where should I start this...","width":448},{"text":"Oh, I will start it here.","width":128},{"text":" It means that we got fast fast fast fast fast, right? All that, no waiting, perfectly fine.","width":512},{"text":"And then, when something comes alone here, we've got....","width":448},{"text":"Waiting time","width":384},{"text":"for data to be copied","width":320},{"text":"And then, things move fast again, right?","width":320},{"text":"So imagine what this means in the algorithm.","width":256},{"text":"It means over the course of your use of your stack, sometimes things are going great.","width":320},{"text":"No problem and sometimes you have to wait a little bit.","width":320},{"text":"Now anytime you don't have the same thing going on. Each time it becomes more complex to analyze.","width":512},{"text":"So what we are gonna do is to add up all the data we insert and items.","width":448},{"text":"We're gonna look at all the data that we insert and items.","width":320},{"text":"And we're also gonna look at the amount of time that we spend waiting over that time.","width":384},{"text":"And it turns out, if you look at the amount of time that you spend waiting, you get wait time on the order of N.","width":960},{"text":"Or constant time on average per push.","width":384},{"text":"So it's a rare long wait.","width":576},{"text":"So the punch line is, its order n for n pushes and the analysis of that comes from last time is a geometric sum","width":1472},{"text":"which means O(n)/n and you can go back and look at your discrete math","width":512},{"text":"and homeworks for proving this, that this is O(1) per push.","width":768},{"text":"on average","width":192},{"text":"We admit some of them are gonna be long but on average. It's just like you are paying a little bit more for each one of them.","width":448},{"text":"Some of them are gonna go faster. Few of them are gonna go way slower.","width":192},{"text":"Okay any questions about that?","width":192},{"text":"Who else raise their hand? You are number 2 in the queue.","width":512},{"text":"(Can't hear)","width":640},{"text":"Umm it doesn't matter. I mean doubling is really easy.","width":192},{"text":"Oh you mean non-one? Oh it turns out that won't make a lot of difference, unless your stack is on average much shorter than the small ones you start off with.","width":768},{"text":"So if you have reason to believe your stack is likely to be pretty short, then yes.","width":448},{"text":"Any other questions?","width":448}]
