[{"text":"Raise your hand if your closet looks more like the lower right.","width":256},{"text":"I assert that there's actually a lot of correlation between night owls and upper left.","width":384},{"text":"and morning person and lower right","width":128},{"text":"but we won't investigate that. That's a question for another time.","width":320},{"text":"Alright, let's do it again. Upper left? Lower right? Ok. Raise your hand if you didn't raise your hand in the last minute.","width":704},{"text":"Why? Why didn't your choose between them?","width":384},{"text":"It's about half and half.","width":384},{"text":"Ah, ok so there's a grey area between the two and that probably where most people are.","width":256},{"text":"How about it I asked you which one you'd like it to be?","width":256},{"text":"Not the left.","width":128},{"text":"Ok. Alright. Did that hurt? And you weren't ready for that at all. We didn't talk about that ahead of time. I don't even know your name.","width":640},{"text":"Alright. Ok so the metaphor here, in case you're missing it, is that not only can we be clever with the mechanism","width":1088},{"text":"we use to search our data. We can be clever with the mechanism we use to arrange our data in the first place.","width":576},{"text":"Now the real question is if you're looking for your purple long sleeve button down.","width":448},{"text":"Would you rather look for it in this closet or in this closet?","width":384},{"text":"Yeah, obviously.","width":512},{"text":"Alright, all you do is go the the button downs and it's right there. Right?","width":192},{"text":"Where this one you do your back linear search.","width":256},{"text":"Alright so, our algorithms and our arrangement of data in memory are two things.","width":512},{"text":"And it's the whole course. Any questions or comments?","width":320},{"text":"Ok what's it like? Eh, you can read that later.","width":320},{"text":"It's a puzzle solving course. My goal every day is to have you go \"Oh, that's cool\" once. Just once during the day.","width":704},{"text":"That's what I want from you. I want you to go \"Oh, cool!\" just one time.","width":384},{"text":"And that's the thinking part of it. Where you're thinking broadenings. Has that happened yet today?","width":448},{"text":"Eh, ok. I don't want to know. Alright.","width":384},{"text":"Where did you come from? So I think that many of you can raise your hand if your introductory course, your prerequisite course is 125. ","width":576},{"text":"That corresponds a lot to the CS majors a probably minors.","width":192},{"text":"Raise your hand--ah this is so hard. I cannot remember what the prerequisite course is for ECE. Which one is it?","width":576},{"text":"Did that hurt?","width":128},{"text":"To talk to me? Ok.","width":128},{"text":"Alright. And what's your name? Matt, ok. Thank you.","width":320},{"text":"Alright. So it is 220. Good alright. That's the prerequisite course.","width":512},{"text":"Now the amazing thing is that you guys in 220. You people in 220 learn everything you need to know about C.","width":576},{"text":"And that means things like pointers and memory and being responsible with your memory.","width":768},{"text":"And if you came from CS 125 it means that you know everything that there is to know about objects.","width":768},{"text":"Well guess what, in this course we seek to unify. And so we're going to use C++. And the dated version for a very deliberate reason.","width":640},{"text":"We're gunna use C++ and the cool thing about it is that there is a little something in for everybody.","width":512},{"text":"C++ has pointers, that is we control our memory at a lower level.","width":512},{"text":"But it's also object oriented.
