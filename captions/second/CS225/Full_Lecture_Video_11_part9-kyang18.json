[{"text":"So how do you declare a type? When I say \"int x(5):\" ","width":565},{"text":"This is simple syntax for declaring an integer.","width":291},{"text":"I want to do this for all of you because I think it's your main point. It reinforces something good.","width":384},{"text":"When I say int x(5), x's copy constructor, which is implemented for us for integers, is invoked and x is instantiated to 5. Not copy constructor. You can do this. Let's just say it that way.","width":1088},{"text":"There is a constructor for integers that will allow you to do this.","width":256},{"text":"Now, it's probably in this assignment. Look at how this matches. ","width":320},{"text":"This is type, this is name of the variable, this is parameters pass to the constructor. You got it? Same thing here.","width":704},{"text":"Type, this is the type of the variable, this is the name of the variable, these are the values pass to the constructor. ","width":640},{"text":"and there is that constructor. Any question about it? You need that name and from then on towNums is one of those things. ","width":571},{"text":"could've been fraud. Alright. so there you go. so This is how you'll be writing your code for mp3. ","width":576},{"text":"It's templatized class. The list class is a templatized class. ","width":448},{"text":"ok. I have some challenges for you to do. let me see where I'm going here. Look we are almost done.","width":880},{"text":"Ok. Go for it. Spend a couple minutes. spend a couple minutes on these. On the three challenges at the bottom.","width":4652},{"text":"That's the other things to say about mp3. We want you to struggle in isolation. ","width":692},{"text":"It's a solo mp to clarify what that means.. It means you can draw pictures with friends, but that sweaty time of debugging and actually correcting the sequence of commands that fulfills the pictures that you draw on the white board. ","width":1280},{"text":"Those have to be done on your own or in the presence of a staff. So don't work with your friends while you are writing the code. ","width":544},{"text":"You can draw pictures all you want but more than two eyes are on the code than that's probably not a valid collaboration in this case.","width":1322},{"text":"Alrignt. How is this going? Anybody want to write their solution on my tablet? ","width":890},{"text":"Anybody want to write their solution? Alright. Fine. I'll do it.","width":458},{"text":"Challenge 1: write the function signature for the copy constructor. It's called ezpair and the name of the function","width":1088}]
