Everything here is greater than 37.","width":448},{"text":"But clearly this is not a binary search tree. So what's missing here?","width":320},{"text":"Must be tree recursively... and TL and TR are Binary search trees.","width":640},{"text":"Okay any questions about it?","width":256},{"text":"Okay.","width":64},{"text":"*Pause*","width":448},{"text":"Alright, so um...","width":320},{"text":"Last time, uh oh we're in trouble, because like you're flipping your page and we're like...","width":448},{"text":"oh it's perfect! We're gonna finish today! Okay!","width":384},{"text":"Last time, when we talked about binary trees, I actually gave you a slide that looked just like this except there was no data in the treeNode structure. Okay?","width":960},{"text":"So I pretty much gave you this slide, but then right before we talked about implementation, but I didn't talk about it...","width":576},{"text":"The reason was because in a general binary tree, insert and remove are illdefined.","width":704},{"text":"We don't have a prescription for where our data can be. For a general binary tree we can put it anywhere we want, and when we go looking for it, we have to employ traversal.","width":768},{"text":"So, it's fine that we saw previous part of the day was just traversal.","width":448},{"text":"","width":64},{"text":"So, but now, now the world changes.","width":384},{"text":"Because now, if I give you a piece of data, say if I give you uhh ooo I don't know 22.","width":640},{"text":"If I give you 22, and say where should I put this in tree? You can go, you can start with the root and go well I don't know where 22 goes, but I do know that it has to in 38's left subtree.","width":1344},{"text":"And then we can do that again, okay so here's another tree. The problem is the same. I need to insert 22 into this tree, and you go okay 22 can't go here.","width":896},{"text":"I already have a node here. I don't know where 22 goes, but it has to go in 13's right subtree. Okay?","width":704},{"text":"Oh, there's no room there.","width":320},{"text":"so Again, I don't know where 22 goes, but it has to go in 25's left subtree and look we've got room for it!","width":832},{"text":"There's nobody it's like, it's like Goldilocks and the Three Bears, there's nobody in, wait not quit like that. I don't know.","width":576},{"text":"There's nobody in my spot. I don't know. Wait.","width":256},{"text":"Thank you.","width":192},{"text":"So, there's room at the incomes mind? There's room there, so we might as well put it there. Any question about that?","width":576},{"text":"Now look what we've just experienced. We've experienced prescription for where a piece of data goes in a binary search tree.","width":960},{"text":"So, you've got a given structure and a new piece of data, there's an algorithm. ","width":384},{"text":"It's a well defined process for figuring out where that value goes. Any question about it?","width":384},{"text":"Moreover, the same thing is true, say, finding a value. I'm gonna look for, well, you tell me what should we look for.","width":640},{"text":"Somebody raise their hand and call a number.","width":256},{"text":"What would be interesting. Oh I know! I've got a quiz for you!","width":320},{"text":"Tell me, something we should look for that would require three comparisons.","width":448},{"text":"Something we should look for that would require three comparisons...","width":384}]
