[{"text":"Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Right. Yes.","width":576},{"text":"Yeah. Yup. Yup. ","width":320},{"text":"Okay. Uh, alright. Any question about the animal class?","width":320},{"text":"The animal struct. Whatever? ","width":128},{"text":"Ok, it is wroth noting that this semicolon is necessary. Just because it is such a common bug we don't want you to deal with.","width":512},{"text":"Alright. So now let us use this class a little bit. ","width":384},{"text":"These are, uh, these are a sequence of valid declarations. ","width":384},{"text":"These are a sequence of valid declarations invoking each of the constructors that we just talked about except the no-argument constructor. ","width":640},{"text":"Okay, except the no-argument constructor.","width":192},{"text":"So here we are declaring a giraffe that eats leaves. Is it big or not?","width":512},{"text":"It is big. Giraffes are big. Dah","width":192},{"text":"Okay. This one is a penguin, uh, who eats fish and is not big.","width":512},{"text":"Right? False. Okay, and B is a big bear that eats you.That is right.","width":576},{"text":"So blobs and bears eat you. Alright. ","width":256},{"text":"Okay, fine. Now I am gonna walk down just a little bit father here and ask you about this one.","width":512},{"text":"What is going on here. What is it. ","width":384},{"text":"You might want to use a \"D\" word in describing this. Yeah? ","width":768},{"text":"Yeah, good. Whose name is? Good, so you are declaring a list of animals named zoo.","width":576},{"text":"So zoo is a list of animals.","width":256},{"text":"So this is using the STL list class.","width":384},{"text":"Now a quick Google search away to find out what the inner face to the list class looks like.","width":576},{"text":"But I will tell you that , the insert. We will call insert at end we were to make a function  we will probably call it insertAtend.","width":704},{"text":"On the standard template library uses push back. Okay? ","width":320},{"text":"So, Uh, we are adding a giraffe to the zoo. ","width":384},{"text":"How many things does it have in it right here.","width":256},{"text":"One, so it's the list of length one by here. And we are adding another thing to the zoo.","width":448},{"text":"And then adding another thing to the zoo.","width":384},{"text":"Any questions about that at all. OK.","width":128},{"text":"Let us take a break then, and take another couple minutes.","width":256},{"text":"And do the same thing with this code. This is gonna take a little bit more on tangling.","width":512},{"text":"You should see something entirely new here. So go on a class and try to figure out this code.","width":448},{"text":"And the only thing up till here is the same. ","width":256},{"text":"Ok, so up till there. This is just the continuation of the code on the previous page.","width":320},{"text":"Take a couple of minutes and figure it out. ","width":896}]
