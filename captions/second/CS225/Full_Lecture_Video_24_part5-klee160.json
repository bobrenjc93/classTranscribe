Okay, okay, and now, I'm going to keep in mind something, I'm going to say something first before I... does this mean it's working?","width":1280},{"text":"Okay, I'm going to do this. Alright, just a minute. So, keep in mind that I'm going to remove 48, but this could just be any two child nodes in some larger tree, right? Like this is just some subtree. So I'm gonna not remove 36 for example and I'm not going to remove 74 because I want you to have a bigger context in which to see what","width":1792},{"text":"What's happening, but I want to remember that it might just be above 48 that there's this humongous binary search tree of which this is just a little part. Alright, so I'm going to do this once and I'll turn that off, I promise.","width":1024},{"text":"Alright, never mind, sorry.","width":192},{"text":"I didn't have you sign the auditory stimulation waiver today so, I can't be too mean to you.","width":576},{"text":"Alright, 48 delete, are you ready? Maybe I should slow it down, I can't read it","width":576},{"text":"More options? The interface used to be better... animation speed... slow it down.","width":1024},{"text":"Okay, and, and bounce height is fine, node size fine, tree size... I'm going to make the tree bigger.","width":768},{"text":"No, reset. No, no, it's so dumb","width":640},{"text":"Close","width":64},{"text":"Alright, now, I'm sorry.","width":320},{"text":"Sometimes a keyboard would just really be nice.","width":320},{"text":"48, and delete, you ready?","width":256},{"text":"Got it? Did you see what happened? Okay, so, what would happen if I did delete 36? What would happen?","width":1344},{"text":"32 would come up, that's right, very good.","width":256},{"text":"What would happen if I deleted 74?","width":256},{"text":"73 would come up. What determines which one swaps in?","width":640},{"text":"It's in the left side, and it is the biggest one on the left side.","width":768},{"text":"We have a special name for it, it's called the In order predecessor.

We could have chosen one in the right subtree instead.","width":896},{"text":"The key observation is when you do an in order traversal of this tree, the order is not ruined, but by removing an element and replacing it with the one whose value comes just before it.

Alright, so remove 13, we have seen an idea of in order predecessor. It is the max element in the left subtree, ","width":2176}]
