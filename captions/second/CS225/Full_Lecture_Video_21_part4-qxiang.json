T","width":631},{"text":"They are both full binary trees.","width":192},{"text":"This is a recursive part.","width":128},{"text":"Ok?","width":320},{"text":" So,if you think you are writing a definition about trees and you haven’t use the vocabulary in the recursive definition then you are not finished.
