[{"text":"Okay, turn to a person sitting next to you and see if they drew the same picture you did.  ","width":1024},{"text":"And ask them what they think the output will be.","width":448},{"text":"[Talking to students] Up there.  Yep.","width":704},{"text":"Yes so I haven't started the node stuff yet.  I might end up replicating them.","width":640},{"text":"Alright somebody speak for the crowd what you think the output is going to be?","width":448},{"text":"Somebody tell me... Yes? [Student answers] 25 for the first one and... how about that second one? Garbage for the second one.","width":640},{"text":"Ill tell you right now that that would be good news because the intention here is clearly to be done with that memory right?  That is kind of what we are saying when we say delete p we are saying we are done with p now.","width":1024},{"text":"We can use the memory assosciated with p, but heres the problem.  uhhhhhhhh","width":704},{"text":"Ready.  Ready for this. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh","width":1088},{"text":"Okay.  So look at your picture you have p and q pointing to 25 right.  And you basically, when we said delete p, all you did was make that memory available for the system to use again. ","width":1216},{"text":"You did not pull back the pointers effectively.  The pointers still point to that space and that space for the moment still holds 25. Any questions about that?","width":896},{"text":"So I could do this as well.  I could do even after I delete p, I can ask for its value.","width":1088},{"text":"(talking to herself) My hands are shaking today I do not know why.","width":192},{"text":"And still I can access it.  Yikes! Yes?","width":576},{"text":"[Student asking a question]","width":704},{"text":"Thats a really good question.  Um so any other application can also use it at that time, but for our purposes we do not need to think about it very much.  It depends on the virtual machine that is set up around that memory. Okay.","width":1024},{"text":"Alright so but for our purposes you do not really need to think about other processes because you dont even have to its broken anyway.  Watch this, let me see if I can make this happen.","width":704},{"text":"Alright so we deleted p which means we gave it back to the system to use. For example I can say q equal new int.  What value should we put in there?","width":832},{"text":"5 okay.  Fine.  And now when I say... uhhh the value if I ask for the value of p.","width":896},{"text":"So I am going to change this to a new hue.  Lets see what happens.","width":1216},{"text":"[output on screen]  before del p: 25, after del p: 25, after new q: 5","width":448}]
