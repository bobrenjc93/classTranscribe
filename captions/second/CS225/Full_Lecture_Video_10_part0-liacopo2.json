My clock says it's eleven o'clock so let's get going.","width":5627},{"text":"You haven't even asked for it yet, but I'm giving you an extension on the extra credit portion of MP3.","width":641},{"text":"On the website it says it's due on the 22nd and I just I said on the slides it was due on the 25th so we'll go with the 25th that's fine.","width":653},{"text":"Yea right, yayyy.","width":168},{"text":"Oh you're so welcome.
