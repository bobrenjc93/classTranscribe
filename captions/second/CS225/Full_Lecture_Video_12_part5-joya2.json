[{"text":"Who got it?","width":640},{"text":"Want to do it? Somebody want to write it?","width":256},{"text":"Okay, I'm going to talk loud and do it, okay?","width":256},{"text":"So I need to make a new, I need to make a new list node here whose value is six and I know just how to do that. It's going to something very much like this line.","width":704},{"text":"So this is going to be list node pointer new equal new list node...","width":768},{"text":"Oh, int six.","width":320},{"text":"Okay, I'm going to give myself clearance here, okay? You're going to want to raise your hand a hundred times over the next few days and say, \"You forgot a template!\", okay?","width":832},{"text":"I hereby absolve myself from the responsibility for including every last template.","width":320},{"text":"If it looks like I need one here and here, please just pretend that I did it, okay?","width":512},{"text":"These are compiler errors at worst, so, you know. We're much deeper than compilers here.","width":448},{"text":"Okay, so I have list node pointer, I better not use-- that isn't \"new\", that is n-u-u.","width":512},{"text":"Alright, new... u-u. Okay, it isn't the word \"new\".","width":320},{"text":"Equals new list node six. Okay, so now what I have is something that looks like this...","width":576},{"text":"Right, and I have \"yum\" over here.","width":192},{"text":"So here's six, here's \"yum\" like this. Hmm... how am I going to do that?","width":384},{"text":"Hmm... this is n-u-u.","width":448},{"text":"Nuu dot next equals yum, good.","width":832},{"text":"And...","width":128},{"text":"No... what next?","width":320},{"text":"Good, and then yum equals nuu.","width":640},{"text":"Yeah? You like it? It's okay?","width":384},{"text":"Okay, because that means now nuu next, I'm going to do this in green.","width":448},{"text":"Nuu next equal yum, that means it points way over here.","width":320},{"text":"Right? And yum equal nuu, so... that means yum-- oh, wow! That was cool.","width":576},{"text":"Woah! That's really cool!","width":256},{"text":"Now yum points to nuu. And look! It looks just the same, right? Yum goes to there goes to back to where it used to be, okay? Any question about it?","width":704},{"text":"Alright, so if you have not started MP3 yet, MP3 is like... it is like a million of these kinds of puzzles in much more complex scenarios.","width":960},{"text":"Moreover, in MP3, instead of just having a next pointer, we also have a previous pointer going to the previous element in a chain of these things.","width":1024},{"text":"Okay, so let's write, let's write a little bit more code here.","width":256},{"text":"We did an exercise that we probably want to generalize and replicate. This inserting something at the front.","width":512},{"text":"Okay, so here's what I'm going to assume is the setup.","width":256},{"text":"I'm going to assume that I have a series of these linked nodes and I'm holding on to them by a list node pointer called head.","width":896},{"text":"Okay? Any question about that? Is that alright with you?","width":256},{"text":"Okay, and we've already somehow built these up, kind of like we put the two together on the previous page,","width":384},{"text":"Now what I want to do is to write a function that, given a chain of these things, will just insert one at the front, okay?","width":704},{"text":"Alright, so let's do that. Hmm...","width":256},{"text":"How does this go? Do you want to write it, or shall I write it?","width":448}]
