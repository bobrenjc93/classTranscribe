[{"text":"Okay my clock says its a 11 o clock so let's get going. Umm. You haven't even asked for it yet but Im giving you an extension on the extra credit portion of mp3. ","width":1259},{"text":"On the website it says its due on the 22nd and I just said that on the slides it was due on the 25th so we will go with the 25th. Youre welcome. I'd like to say anytime but that's not quite true either. We have more printouts coming so if you don't get a print out they'll be there.","width":1065},{"text":"I swear I alway sprint out enough and they disappear I don't know who s taking these printouts who wants them. Maybe its sabotage. Okay so mp2 was due last night yes? Okay it was. Does anyone know how long the queue was? 66 people. Yeah no no. So that's like 10 percent of the class was on the queue. Can you guess how I feel about that. ","width":1546},{"text":"So that says is that 10 percent of the people were working on the problem and got stuck so that means even if a higher proportion of the class was working on the mp at the last second so that just breaks my heart. Umm. Because its so fun you want to do it early. So here's the thing, I can't promise you that the queue wait times will improve.","width":1171},{"text":"I can't promise you that. Now do you see how meta that was. Because if I say I can't promise you the queue wait will improve then you wont count on it and youll go earlier in the week and spread out your requests and then the queue times will improve. ","width":916},{"text":"So there's this kind of thing going on there. So I refuse to promise that the wait times on the queue will improve. There should be huge incentive to start early and finish early. I think course staff is most broadly available at like 9 o'clock in the morning or 10 o'clock in the morning. Think about your fellow students schedules and plan accordingly.","width":949},{"text":"Its this interesting problem right? like the flow of the crowd. We do try but 60 people on the queue is an awful lot of people.It was bad monday night too. Oh the other thing. course staff actually asked me to tell you that you have now have two labs whose focus was debugging so they are exerting you encouraging you to try to be a little more independent. When you run into a problem. Instead of just putting your name on the queue go ahead and be a little more tenacious than a month ago in trying to figure it out yourself that's going to be a valuable skill in going forward.","width":2082}]
