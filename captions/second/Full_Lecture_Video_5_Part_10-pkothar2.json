[{"text":"Now its a little weird, its isn't checking for self assignment, it is checking whether it is being assigned to something that has the same values as me. So that could be self assignment, but it could also be true in a whole bunch of other cases. I could have a whole bunch of books that could be copies of some book before that will all be equal. It isn't doing a self assignment check, it still would be fine to clear a copy in the case that they're equal but that if-statement is definitely not doing a self assignment check anymore. It's true for a whole bunch of cases not just self assignment.","width":2688},{"text":"It also is really nonefficient. Imagine I have the bible on the left, and A Dance of Dragons on the right. Got these two huge books and compare every single line and see if theyre equal.","width":1157},{"text":"Or maybe, in a pathological case, I've added a random period to a sentence in the bible. And left hand side is nonmodified, and right hand side is the modified bible. And the place that it's different is the very very very last line of revelations.","width":1041},{"text":"Okay, so it's gonna go through the entire bible comparing these strings, which is gonna be really slow, these lines are all very long, and theres a lot of them. It'll take forever to do this comparison. And it's gonna go all the way to the end. ","width":960},{"text":"Now you're gonna do a copy. So that was totally useless. All I care about here is the case where I'm assigning into myself. So this is very inefficient if it's doing an actual valuewise comparison between the left and the right hand side. So this is massively slow. Whereas if we do this, what we had before.","width":1792},{"text":"One comparison, is this number that number? Super fast, theres a hardware instruction for it, practically no runtime penalty at all. Just a branch. But it's not like it is gonna matter like if I had two huge books that are like one character different on each side. If they're not the same object, true. Does it matter if I'm off by one character or three, or anything. It's just that they're not the same object.","width":2176},{"text":"Right, so this is kinda the right way to do a self assignment check. Tomorrow we will start here and start talking about some really cool C++11 and C++14 semantics. Move semantics and Rvalue references.","width":1408}]
