negative 1 in every node","width":704},{"text":"I believe so","width":1792},{"text":"If you want a good answer to this ansd sit down with paper and show a counter example","width":384},{"text":"i don't believe that it'll work in the general case","width":256},{"text":"Because you've got to be really careful about making this general","width":448},{"text":"When you've got subtrees everywhere","width":192},{"text":"This could be happening way up in the tree where everything below is balanced","width":320},{"text":"If you do node swpaping you gotta be a little bit carefuk","width":256},{"text":"You cut 20","width":576},{"text":"I'm not sure I see the picture maybe","width":832},{"text":"I'd have to work it out on paper","width":320},{"text":"This is how we'll do ti","width":128},{"text":"it*","width":64},{"text":"Let's move on","width":448},{"text":"When do I know when to pick the first one when do I know to pick the second one","width":448},{"text":"i have two cases","width":64},{"text":"Let me name this rotation where I'm gonna do a left rotate first followed by right rotate is gonna be left right rotate","width":640},{"text":"Has an anlogy for the same picture just mirrored","width":1472},{"text":"Same thing if we have the mirror of that image","width":320},{"text":"you could do right rotate first followed by left rotate","width":192},{"text":"The same story is true just for the mirror image","width":320},{"text":"Different names","width":128},{"text":"Nothing really about the processes any different","width":320},{"text":"Just swapping left with right","width":128},{"text":"The question today is how do you figure out which of these to invoke","width":512},{"text":"If I'm at a node and I know that this node is imbalanced","width":256},{"text":"So I'm at 70 in this case and I know that 70 is imbalanced","width":256},{"text":"How do I know","width":64},{"text":"Whether it's going to be a left rotate or a right rotate","width":384},{"text":"Ignoring the double rotate case","width":256},{"text":"Let's call a left right rotate a version of a right rotate","width":384},{"text":"The overall thing that is fixing is right rotate","width":256},{"text":"you just happen to do a left first","width":128},{"text":"Left right rotate and right rotate are both right rotate","width":256},{"text":"right left rotate and left rotate are both left rotate","width":64},{"text":"So how do I figure out whether I do a left rotation or a right rotation","width":448},{"text":"So the sign of the balance facotr right","width":192},{"text":"I know that I have to do a rotation at all when the balance factor is bigger than one","width":384},{"text":"Then I know I have to do a rebalance","width":128},{"text":"Furthermore I have to look at the sign once it's absolute value is two","width":320},{"text":"I can look at the sign and tell which side is heavy one","width":256},{"text":"If sign is positive","width":128},{"text":"I am hevay on the left side","width":192},{"text":"So I should do a right rotation","width":128},{"text":"I want to move things from left to right","width":256},{"text":"If sign is negative","width":64},{"text":"I know I am heavy on the right side","width":192},{"text":"I need to a rotation from right ot left so I need to do a left rotation","width":256},{"text":"Now once I figured out","width":192},{"text":"In this case","width":64},{"text":"The balance factor of 70 is 2","width":320},{"text":"I need to do a right rotation","width":320},{"text":"Some kind of right rotation about the 70","width":192},{"text":"Now how do I know whether its going to be a regular right rotation or a left right rotation","width":384},{"text":"So check sort of the sign of the balance factor of the heavy side","width":640},{"text":"Sign is positive","width":256},{"text":"Hey 40 what's your balance factor","width":192},{"text":"40 will go its negative 1","width":192},{"text":"The heavy side's factor doesn't agree with mine so I know I must have a picture that looks like a dog leg","width":704},{"text":"And the same thing is true on the other side","width":384},{"text":"If this is the mirror image","width":128},{"text":"the balance factor of the root would be a minus 2 and look at the child's balance","width":448},{"text":"Notice the signs don't agree but have a dog legged picture","width":320},{"text":"just the mirrored image","width":64},{"text":"The two cases are sort of","width":512},{"text":"I do the first when the balance","width":128},{"text":"factor of the heavy child agrees with the inbalance","width":1280},{"text":"so in this case if we look up to a regular old left rotate","width":768},{"text":"the balance factor of 80 is what?","width":320},{"text":"balance factor of 80- is minus two","width":576},{"text":"Height of the right side is 2 and height of the left side is 0","width":320},{"text":"0 minus two is minus two","width":192},{"text":"Its heavy on the right side","width":192},{"text":"I'll do some sort of left rotation","width":192},{"text":"I ask 90 balance factor","width":128},{"text":"Negative 1","width":384},{"text":"Cause tis heavy on the right side","width":256},{"text":"Sign of balance factors agree","width":192},{"text":"80 was negative 90 was negative","width":128},{"text":"I know all the heaviness agrees and exists on the right side","width":256},{"text":"So I can do a regular left rotate","width":192},{"text":"In this case","width":64},{"text":"I say 70 whats your balance factor","width":576},{"text":"2","width":64},{"text":"Heavy on the left side","width":256},{"text":"So then I ask","width":64},{"text":"70s left child so 40","width":128},{"text":"What is your balance factor","width":64},{"text":"-1","width":128},{"text":"So those signs disagree","width":192},{"text":"So I need to do a double rotation","width":128},{"text":"I need to first do a left rotation about the child and then do a right rotation about myself","width":576},{"text":"I need to do a left right rotation","width":128}]
