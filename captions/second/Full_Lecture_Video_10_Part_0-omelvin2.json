if waiting, then another process or thread (if you're talking about threads) can only enter the critical section a finite number of times","width":727.1818182468414},{"text":"what do we call that?","width":156.18181824684143},{"text":"this is a better definition of bounded wait","width":356.18181824684143},{"text":"if you're waiting to use the resource, if you're waiting to be inside the critical section","width":305.18181824684143},{"text":"it would be unfair if another thread just kept on jumping in front of you in front of the queue","width":274.18181824684143},{"text":"so we want a solution where eventually we get to go in","width":383.18181824684143},{"text":"alright and then if no other process is in the critical section then the process or thread can immediately enter the critical section","width":424.18181824684143},{"text":"our code should be efficient. it shouldn't have to pause. if there's no one inside the bathroom, I expect to use it straight away","width":457.18181824684143},{"text":"alright, so, what's that called?","width":179.18181824684143},{"text":"progress! yes.","width":82.18181824684143},{"text":"so those are our three desired properties that we're going to evaluate","width":439.18181824684143},{"text":"alright. now there's um, one more thing that I think","width":215.18181824684143},{"text":"that I should mention is that we're talking about pseudocode right now. but today, if you were to look inside say, mutex lock, and you were to drill down to find out exactly how it worked, you might discover that it uses something called the exchange instruction","width":1076.1818182468414},{"text":"so many processors today will implement either test&set or the exchange instruction","width":458.18181824684143},{"text":"what do you think the exchange instruction does?","width":243.18181824684143},{"text":"okay, it exchanges something, yes, very good, but what might it exchange?","width":573.1818182468414},{"text":"how about a value inside a register and the contents of memory","width":418.18181824684143},{"text":"so it swaps them","width":173.18181824684143},{"text":"but here's the critical part: is that it does this atomically. it does this in the guerilla fashion. it walks up and it exchanges your hats","width":762.1818182468414},{"text":"actually no, I'll take your cellphone, that's more valuable, right?","width":218.18181824684143},{"text":"for the microphone oh yeah","width":129.18181824684143},{"text":"and in doing so, no other CPU is allowed to interrupt that process","width":323.18181824684143},{"text":"it completes as one logical step. here you go, you can have your phone back","width":385.18181824684143},{"text":"so that way, we can actually use it to implement our mutex lock because only one thread will win","width":484.18181824684143},{"text":"we can make sure that only one thread gets to put a certain value inside it","width":492.18181824684143},{"text":"so, it's an atomic instruction, why is it useful? well, to implement locks!","width":646.1818182468414},{"text":"we don't have to worry about officially catered code down here and it works even if I got say more than two threads trying to compete to lock something","width":732.1818182468414},{"text":"okay, alright, next thing we're going to talk about is condition variables","width":463.18181824684143},{"text":"I'm going to introduce them now, we'll let that simmer in your brain and then the second half of the lecture we'll come back to them","width":509.18181824684143},{"text":"so like I said, this is the cool bit","width":222.18181824684143},{"text":"condition variables sound like they hold some sort of clever value","width":475.18181824684143},{"text":"they don't","width":147.18181824684143},{"text":"uh, their name actually is very good at confusing beginners","width":360.18181824684143},{"text":"the way to think about condition variables is that you can make your thread meditate","width":576.1818182468414},{"text":"what an exciting lecture isn't it?
