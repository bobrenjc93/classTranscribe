[{"text":"Okay, while I'm waiting for everything to catch up, let's start. As far as announcements go, I am going to try as hard as I possibly can to have this exam back to you in lab on Tuesday; because there will not be lab on Thursday because Thursday is reading day. So I can't give it back to you on Thursday because you won't be there. So I'm going to try my hardest to have it back on Tuesday. We will see if it happens or not, but I'm going to try my darndest. As a reminder, the lab today, you will be working on the first two parts of this mp. So, I encourage you to go to that and pick the TAs brains and stuff while you are working on that. We will cover two of the important algorithms for this mp today and the remaining one, we will have to cover on Monday. When you go to lab, you should have the TAs explain to you the basics of Kruskal's algorithm so you can write it. You do not have to know how to analyze it. We will do that on Monday. One last thing before I jump in, I want to make sure that we are all on the same page here. What does bit stand for? What does bit stand for? Stands for binary digit. Okay, what is a digit. Not a finger, but what is a digit? What's a digit? I give you a ten digit number. What is that? What does that mean? No. What's a digit? A number! A ten digit number is a number that has ten places. You have a seven digit phone number. So a digit is one spot in a number. Okay, so a bit is a binary digit. So it is a spot in a binary number. How many values can a binary digit have? Two. What are those values? 1 and 0. Which one of those values is typically called true? One. Which of those values is typically called false? Okay. How many values can you have in a decimal digit. Ten. 0 through 9. So we know what a digit is. So we know what's that all about. Okay, fine. How many bits are in a byte? Okay. Good. Name one assignment where we have dealt with bits and bytes in this class before the exam. Lab huffman. Right. You were writing bits. When you called write bit it took a bool. It could only be true or false. When you read a byte, you read in 8 bits, uint8_t as in there are 8 bits in that number. Name me one data type other than uint8_t that has 8 bits in it. Char. Okay. I was getting the impression that I may have presumed over much that people knew that there are 8 bits in a byte and a bit can have two values, and only two values, and setting a bit to 2 doesn't make sense. Setting a bit to 8 doesn't make any sense. Setting a bit to \"b\" doesn't make any sense. A bit has values 0 and 1 and that's it. Okay and it's not a foreign concept. We have done things before with them and I feel like we should know what bits and bytes are.","width":27584}]
