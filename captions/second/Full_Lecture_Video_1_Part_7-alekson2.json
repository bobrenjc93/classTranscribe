[{"text":"One of the advantages of using statically typed language is that it allows us to be very clear about what types of data are we operating on","width":832},{"text":"Rather than just I have an a what is it","width":192},{"text":"Is it an integer or a double or a float or an image","width":256},{"text":"Student? What is that","width":256},{"text":"It's easier for us to think exactly what our types","width":256},{"text":"For using a statically typed language","width":64},{"text":"There's nothing wrong with a dynamically language","width":64},{"text":"They're great","width":128},{"text":"I want us to really be focused on exactly what's going on inside of our data structures","width":384},{"text":"Later on implement a data strcuture in a high level lanbguage dynamically typed","width":320},{"text":"Very concrete so statically typed is very nice for this particular class","width":576},{"text":"What was another property","width":256},{"text":"Casts are weird","width":704},{"text":"The answer there is that ","width":256},{"text":"Your variable ","width":192},{"text":"If you're doing a cast you're casting it","width":256},{"text":"Has to put the mjemory for that somwehre","width":320},{"text":"One way of thinking about it ","width":192},{"text":"Maybe I'm casting ","width":192},{"text":"An integer to a double or something","width":256},{"text":"I might say","width":256},{"text":"Double d equals parens double n and an x or soemthing","width":320},{"text":"That's gonna convert the value thats in x into a double and put int the heap","width":448},{"text":"If its just part of the expression and not being assigned into a variable","width":320},{"text":"Then yes the type system sort of breaks down","width":192},{"text":"As if it was another type","width":384},{"text":"Thing is generally bad and dont do it","width":256},{"text":"It's one of those part of being a ","width":448},{"text":"A language based on C","width":192},{"text":"Is you can mess with the type system","width":320},{"text":"And get a wrap","width":128},{"text":"Ideally if you're leveraging with the type system the way it is designed everything should","width":576},{"text":"There are cases where that's useful","width":256},{"text":"Sometimes thats useful","width":128},{"text":"As long as you know what you're doing","width":448},{"text":"What was another propery of C++","width":1280},{"text":"It's compiled","width":512},{"text":"What does it mean for a language to be a compiled lanuage","width":704},{"text":"So a compiled language typically has a separate program called a compiler","width":832},{"text":"That is responsible and taking your source files","width":320},{"text":"Parsing them and understanding them and translating them","width":256},{"text":"Translating those instructions directly into machine instructions","width":512},{"text":"Put into a binary files","width":192},{"text":"Two steps","width":64},{"text":"COmpilation step and this running step","width":192},{"text":"Both of which could have errors","width":128},{"text":"If you have an error during compilation","width":320},{"text":"It means that the compiler couldn't actually maker your program because something inside of the program is not syntatcially valid so it doesnt know how to translate that","width":640},{"text":"Expression into machine code because it is not a valid C++ expression","width":64},{"text":"It only knows how to translate valid C++ expressions","width":192},{"text":"Into machine code","width":64},{"text":"Something that is not C++ \"IDK what that is\"","width":256},{"text":"To it you gave a Java program","width":256},{"text":"I'm not  Java compiler Idk what you're doing","width":256},{"text":"The compiler step could have error","width":320},{"text":"Which means that somehow your code is not syntactically valid C++ ","width":128},{"text":"Your runtime could have errors meaning you could have made a programming mistake","width":448},{"text":"You used ngeative one in an array index","width":192},{"text":"Negative as an array index up to the end","width":320},{"text":"Like it does in some scripting languages","width":256},{"text":"We'll talk about arrays and stuff later","width":512},{"text":"Just because the program compiles does not mean it will run wihtout errors","width":384},{"text":"Your algorithm could be wrong","width":128},{"text":"Your for loop could be off by one","width":128},{"text":"Your recursion could not have a base case","width":192},{"text":"Doesn't mean it is going to run properly","width":320},{"text":"But if it runs that means everything is syntatcially valid code","width":320},{"text":"So you don't have to catch those when yo run the program","width":192},{"text":"So you elimniate a large class of these errors","width":192},{"text":"It's nice because you know you only have to think about a certain types of errors","width":448},{"text":"Does the code do what I thoight it did","width":192},{"text":"What's the alternative to this","width":320},{"text":"It's not the only alternative","width":192},{"text":"What's the counter","width":128},{"text":"Interpreted languages","width":448},{"text":"In an interpreted languages","width":128},{"text":"Trhere is still a second program","width":128},{"text":"That is going to run and take your source file and uderstand the semantics and translate that into something that can actually bve run","width":576},{"text":"It doesn't do the whole program at once","width":192},{"text":"It does it line by line","width":64},{"text":"Sometimes it is especially if you're just running the interpreter witthout any code at all","width":576},{"text":"Often called read-eval loop","width":128},{"text":"Reads in the line of code","width":128},{"text":"It evaluates figures out what it means and does that","width":256},{"text":"And prints out the result","width":64},{"text":"Problem since it is not seeing your entire program at once","width":256},{"text":"If you give it an entire expression at once","width":256},{"text":"It doesn't know how to run","width":128},{"text":"So now all of the things we would catch in C++ as compiler errors are now turned into runtime errors when you run","width":512},{"text":"So if you have a typo and mistyped a variable at the very end of the function","width":256},{"text":"And that function is computing the position of all the atoms in a very large physics simulation","width":512},{"text":"And you're doing this in an interpreted language","width":192},{"text":"Youre not gonna know you have a mistyped variable","width":192},{"text":"Until end of simulation","width":128},{"text":"Its about to output results to some filer you're gonna use for your paper submission","width":576},{"text":"Now you have to rerun the whole ","width":128},{"text":"Whereas if you have a compiler the compiler will be \"Hey I don't know what that is\"","width":512},{"text":"It's nice to have a compiler in some cases","width":64}]
