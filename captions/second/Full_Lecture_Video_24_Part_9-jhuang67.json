[{"text":"Alright.","width":128},{"text":"Where those two slots in the middle just never ever had anything in them.","width":192},{"text":"Okay.","width":128},{"text":"And I ask you to find 29 .","width":128},{"text":"Alright.","width":128},{"text":"You will go to here see that there is an  8 there and it's an occupied cell so I should probe forward.","width":576},{"text":"So now I look here and see that that cell is unoccupied. ","width":320},{"text":"Which means that that 29 can not appear in the table.","width":256},{"text":"If 29 was there,I would have been sorted at this position. ","width":192},{"text":"Because it is an unoccupied cell and it's never been occupied ever.","width":192},{"text":"The only case where I probe down farther is if there's something there. ","width":256},{"text":"So if there was never anything here I know that my find is done.","width":192},{"text":"Right? Does that make sense?","width":64},{"text":"I may have to probe forward if there was ever something there.","width":192},{"text":"Whether it's currently there or not.","width":256},{"text":"Right? And I can stop if I find either I got in back where I started which means that I scan the whole table and it can't be there.","width":320},{"text":"Or I find the slot that's never ever been occupied before which means that it couldn't exist in the table.","width":448},{"text":"[Students are asking question]","width":384},{"text":"So right.","width":64},{"text":"Okay.","width":1216},{"text":"So your question is let's say we have this ,right?","width":192},{"text":"And we did a remove 11. So we get rid of the 11 .We set its state.","width":192},{"text":"to removed.","width":192},{"text":"And we do another insert 11?","width":128},{"text":"[Students are talking]","width":448},{"text":"Yes. It still would have to.","width":384},{"text":"You have to look until I got here.","width":192},{"text":"Yeah.","width":192},{"text":"So if you ever have a cell that was flagged as something was removed from here,you still may have to look forward,even if there's nothing there.","width":448},{"text":"Right?","width":64},{"text":"If I didn't insert this point, if I didn't insert 11,I can still insert into a cell that in the removed state.","width":512},{"text":"Right?","width":64},{"text":"Because all the remove state tells me that I should probe forward.","width":128},{"text":"There are used to be something here so I do need to look forward in case there in case something collided with whatever used to be here.","width":448},{"text":"But if I'm doing an insertion, I can just put 11. 11 would hash here so I move forward by 1 and this is a remove state,which means that I can place the element there.","width":512},{"text":"So now it would go back to occupied.","width":128},{"text":"It will never go back to unoccupied.","width":128},{"text":"Okay?","width":192},{"text":" yeah.","width":64},{"text":"[Student's talking]","width":192},{"text":"Okay,so we will prove that in a second.","width":128},{"text":"Yes.","width":64},{"text":"[Student's talking] ","width":384},{"text":"Yes.So the observation here is this removal on this sort of structure is kind of bad.","width":704},{"text":"Because if you managed to get most of the cells sort of into the remove state, then you will probe forward a whole bunch.","width":640},{"text":"So you'd have a really sort of really nasty looking running time if you did whole bunch of removals.","width":192},{"text":"There are hacks around that. We will do them in the lab.","width":320},{"text":"One thing you can do is trying once you got the table below a certain load factor,you can just shrink the table bound and set everything to unoccupied again. And then you get a fresh table very once in a while.","width":768},{"text":"You have to be able to argue that you can do that and still make things amortized. ","width":256},{"text":"So it gets little fussy.","width":128},{"text":"Removal on these open addressing tables is sort of a little difficult.","width":384},{"text":"For that reason.","width":192},{"text":"Okay.","width":192},{"text":"So we will prove now that we can still argue that things are amortized constant with this kind of set up.","width":640},{"text":"And again the intuition is going to be that we can't ever let this table get too full.","width":384},{"text":"Because whenever it gets too full, there is a lots of things that are next to each other and my probing sequence will get really long.","width":448},{"text":"So one will be able to guarantee this table is sufficiently large so that there are a lot of blank unoccupied state cells so that my find and stuff can terminate early.","width":576},{"text":"Right? If my insert can find empty cells pretty easily and not have to probe through a bunch of clusters right?","width":320},{"text":"So I need to be able to say I 'm still going to make an argument about sort of what the overall load factor looks like and then show that my running time is depending on that load factor. ","width":640},{"text":"And so if I can fix that load factor, my running times on average are fixed.","width":256},{"text":"Okay.","width":64},{"text":"So the way we are going to do that is by looking at the expected number of probe.","width":448},{"text":"Right? We know that intuitively like think of an insert.","width":192},{"text":"Right?","width":64},{"text":"The running of an insert depends on the number of the probes forward you had to do until you find an open cell.Right?","width":384},{"text":"So if we can bound the expected number of probes we have to do to an insert, then we can say that the expected running time of insert is whatever we bounded at that x.","width":960},{"text":"Right?","width":64},{"text":"So what I'm trying to argue here is that the expected number of probe forward in the table is some constent.","width":448},{"text":"It will be a constant that depends on alfas that we have to make sure that alfa is fixed .","width":192},{"text":"But if I can make alfa fixed, I can argue this is constant.","width":192},{"text":"This is how I'm going to do it.","width":64},{"text":"I'm going to go off into stat land for a bit.","width":128},{"text":"I know statistic is not a prerequisite for this course so if you don't understand what's going on ,you can let your eyes glaze over until I write down the actual result. ","width":448},{"text":"If you know statistic then follow along.","width":128},{"text":"Okay.So what we going to do here is that we can model this using some distribution from stat.","width":640},{"text":"So we can think of this sort of bunch of random trials, if we assume every probe is independent ,which is not true.","width":576},{"text":"But e are going to assume that every probe is independent for the sake of analysis.","width":256},{"text":"Every time we probe forward, our success...if we are thinking of newly trials, what's our probability of success? ","width":576},{"text":"Alright? Our success story is when we find a unoccupied cell.","width":320},{"text":"So our success probability is the probability that for the random cell that we are looking at that is unoccupied.  ","width":512},{"text":"Okay?","width":128},{"text":"So we will say that we will let p be our probability of success.","width":704},{"text":"which in this case is an empty cell.","width":256},{"text":"[writing]","width":64},{"text":"And we will say each probe is an independent ...","width":1024},{"text":"[writing]","width":128},{"text":"Each probe is an independent Bernoull trial.","width":448},{"text":"Okay?","width":128},{"text":"So what is p?","width":128},{"text":"So the probability of success ...what is the probability that if I look at some random cell in my table ,what's the probability that that cell is empty?","width":704}]
