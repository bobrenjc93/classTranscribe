[{"text":"okay","width":1024},{"text":"good morning and welcome back from spring break","width":256},{"text":"you might recognize that music as part of the Star Wars music, we'll find out why in a little bit","width":448},{"text":"good","width":64},{"text":"well what we're going to do today, of course, is talk about networking","width":128},{"text":"here we are towards the end of the semester and the major topics we're going to look at is networking","width":576},{"text":"that is, how we can connect one computer to the rest of the internet","width":128},{"text":"and also how can we deal with scheduling and files and a few of the, kind of, loose ends towards the end of the semester","width":512},{"text":"so this is it, right?","width":64},{"text":"this is the part of the systems programming that allows us to watch Star Wars on a computer from another machine, or anything else who you'll find on Youtube, which of course, was invented here by a student","width":896},{"text":"and we'll see how you might've even seen Star Wars prior to Youtube","width":384},{"text":"so let's, kind of, take a look at that, right","width":320},{"text":"so let's get started","width":192},{"text":"first of all, kind of a little bit of sure case for, perhaps you're interested in networking, we're not going to all networking, or course in 241","width":640},{"text":"but, there are courses here that take it a lot further","width":256},{"text":"so this is really just some highlights of first of all, if you wanted to know about networking and you wanted to able to talk like you know where you sound","width":512},{"text":"you sound like you're very to quick to start talking about the OSI model","width":320},{"text":"and this is really just a set of abstraction layers, so when you talk about vulnerabilities, or you want to design a protocol, you're actually going to be doing it inside one of these levels","width":768},{"text":"so let's have a look at some of these","width":192},{"text":"okay","width":128},{"text":"so, for example, our friends over at the ECE building","width":320},{"text":"they worry about the physical level, like what voltages do I want and how am I going to represent my 1's and 0's etc.","width":512},{"text":"241, we're going to be playing mostly with in this level in terms of looking at packets and different mechanisms of transport","width":768},{"text":"in particular, we're going to be playing with TCP and UDP","width":256},{"text":"that's not the whole story though because of course, we don't want to simply send a packet of arbitrary data","width":448},{"text":"we like to make applications","width":192},{"text":"applications themselves have protocol","width":320},{"text":"so, if TCP and UDP are methods, are well-defined ways to communicate at lower level, at the higher level, you're going to find things like HTTP","width":704},{"text":"when do you see HTTP?","width":128},{"text":"websites! yes sir, if you wanted to talk to a web server, you need to know how to talk HTTP, and there's a document about that","width":576},{"text":"about how what it means to talk HTTP, what bytes you should send, what responses you should get","width":384},{"text":"if you want to send mail, there's a prototype called SMTP","width":256},{"text":"alright, so how about all of these different kind of levels of protocol","width":448},{"text":"inside CS 241","width":320},{"text":"what are we going to see?","width":64},{"text":"well, we're going to see, like I said TCP, UDP","width":192},{"text":"most of the internet today, as you know, uses IPv4, or often shortened to just IP4, or even sometimes IP","width":576},{"text":"and this is an addressing protocol that allows me to talk to machines, but we only use 32 bits","width":448},{"text":"to describe the endpoints, the starting point and the endpoint","width":384},{"text":"so we're limited because we have more devices than that","width":192},{"text":"so don't panic, we came up with a new protocol called IPv6","width":192},{"text":"which now has 128 bit addressing","width":192},{"text":"except even though it was designed many years ago, it still represents less than 5% of today's traffic and it still has problems that you'll find routers, which are misconfigured throughout the internet and IPv6 is not yet as reliable as it should be","width":1024},{"text":"right","width":64},{"text":"but there are, okay","width":128},{"text":"so that's the kind of as far as we go in terms of these lower level protocols","width":448},{"text":"i'll show you what the actual bytes look like for IPv4 and IPv6 in another lecture","width":448},{"text":"but for now, we're just going to say, hey this stuff exists, and this is the way I can send data from one machine to another machine","width":448},{"text":"so let's have a look at this TCP and UDP","width":320},{"text":"alright, first of all, we better understand what they stand for","width":384},{"text":"so UDP is \"user datagram protocol\"","width":960},{"text":"so, by the way, the word datagram comes from data and telegram","width":512},{"text":"it's like this, I want to send this telegram to you and I'm not quite sure when it's going to arrive and in fact, if I send two telegrams to you, maybe they'll arrive out of order","width":512},{"text":"maybe we'll get lost along the way, the carrier pigeon will be eaten by a hawk","width":448},{"text":"who knows, right?","width":64},{"text":"we don't know whether the information I send will truly get to the endpoint","width":384},{"text":"maybe a scribe will actually send you two of these things","width":256},{"text":"so, we talk about datagrams when we have this unreliable delivery mechanism","width":448},{"text":"so that's its main characteristic, it's unreliable","width":192},{"text":"and that pen doesn't work too well, so let's a different one","width":128},{"text":"unreliable","width":128},{"text":"so we can get our datagrams out of order","width":832},{"text":"if your general says, \"hey! retreat!\", and another telegrams says, \"hey! advance!\"","width":576},{"text":"without actually putting your own timestamp information inside that, you don't know which one is sent first","width":384},{"text":"so UDP gives you no guarantees about when things are going to arrive, the order of things going to arrive, and whether you have missing data, or even duplicate data","width":1088},{"text":"so, essentially it's making no guarantees about the lower levels of the internet","width":960},{"text":"it's saying, if there's any problems, if someone decides to disconnect the cable, or the router between you and me is misbehaving, you're open to those problems","width":576},{"text":"you have to deal with it","width":128},{"text":"but","width":128},{"text":"it's fast","width":320},{"text":"there's no handshaking","width":320},{"text":"as soon as I send a packet, and arrives at your end, you see it","width":512},{"text":"okay, so one of the main characteristics is it's unreliable, what does that mean?","width":448},{"text":"we may see dups","width":64},{"text":"we may see missing datagrams","width":512},{"text":"it may be out of order","width":384},{"text":"so there's no guarantee about sequencing","width":192},{"text":"essentially, it's saying, \"yeah, I've got a post office and I've got telegram service, but I make not guarantees about how good it is\"","width":640},{"text":"\"it might change from second to second\"","width":64}]
