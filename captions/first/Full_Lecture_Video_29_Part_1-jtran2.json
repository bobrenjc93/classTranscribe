","width":128},{"text":"So what we're going to do to all going to talk about it after the rest of the lecture","width":192},{"text":"Okay so we've got a problem then, if that's the big idea, how are we going organize things into directories","width":320},{"text":"How are we actually going to give things names if we're saying their names is not actually part of the file","width":320},{"text":"Well, all we're going to say then is the name is actually part of a directory listing.","width":384},{"text":"So, a directory then will have","width":448},{"text":"A listing, and the listing will be","width":192},{"text":"A name","width":192},{"text":"And","width":128},{"text":"An inode number","width":192},{"text":"A name, and an inode number. etc etc etc etc","width":448},{"text":"In fact, we can think of a directory as just a file","width":640},{"text":"We'll bless it, we'll set a particular binding flag to say this isn't actually a user file,","width":384},{"text":"it's actually part of the file system","width":128},{"text":"And uh we'll need to read the contents and expect the bytes to mean the following","width":320},{"text":"The name followed by an inode number.
