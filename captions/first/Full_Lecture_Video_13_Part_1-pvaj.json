[{"text":"well","width":192},{"text":"you can think of this buffer","width":192},{"text":"as a ","width":64},{"text":"as something that we call a","width":192},{"text":"ring buffer","width":64},{"text":"where","width":64},{"text":"its not","width":192},{"text":"you have kind of taken","width":128},{"text":"the two ends of the buffer","width":192},{"text":"that we were using","width":128},{"text":"and have connected them ","width":128},{"text":"on the other side ","width":64},{"text":"right","width":64},{"text":"and now ","width":64},{"text":"we need be able to put things in","width":320},{"text":"and take them out","width":64},{"text":"and ","width":64},{"text":"I could just","width":64},{"text":"chase my own tail","width":128},{"text":"forever","width":64},{"text":"and never working about","width":192},{"text":"running off the end","width":64},{"text":"so conceptually","width":64},{"text":"there are a number of things","width":128},{"text":"that I have to have","width":128},{"text":"to be able to make this work","width":192},{"text":"so I am the producer","width":128},{"text":"what do I need to know","width":64},{"text":"what is the producer need to know ","width":384},{"text":"for thee","width":64},{"text":"the producer is putting things in","width":256},{"text":"yeah","width":64},{"text":"the producer is","width":704},{"text":"what is filling up my array basically","width":256},{"text":"say Im starting off with an array","width":192},{"text":"so lets have a pointer in here","width":192},{"text":"that says","width":64},{"text":"okay","width":64},{"text":"uhmm","width":64},{"text":"in","width":64},{"text":"im going to put it in there","width":256},{"text":"I just started at some place random","width":192},{"text":"if Im smart","width":128},{"text":"my underlying datastructure","width":256},{"text":"might have just started right there","width":192},{"text":"yeah, I would have wrapped the two ends","width":64},{"text":"okay so now","width":64},{"text":"that the producer has put something in","width":256},{"text":"what does the produce have to do","width":256},{"text":"in isnt right anymroe","width":192},{"text":"you have to increment in","width":192},{"text":"to now point here","width":128},{"text":"theres were my next one will be","width":192},{"text":"so thats my produce","width":320},{"text":"what does my consumer need to know","width":256},{"text":"Ill tell you","width":128},{"text":"its out","width":64},{"text":"a pointer to","width":192},{"text":"what","width":64},{"text":"the first one that I wanted to take out","width":320},{"text":"the first case is ere","width":192},{"text":"Ill make the consumer blue","width":192},{"text":"and as the","width":64},{"text":"consumer puts things in here","width":192},{"text":"its going to slowly increment in","width":256},{"text":"to be there","width":64},{"text":"and as the consumer takes things out","width":256},{"text":"it will","width":320},{"text":"delete them out of the ring buffer","width":320},{"text":"although I guess it really doesnt matter","width":256},{"text":"and that is the next one to take out","width":192},{"text":"so there are two things that we have to be careful about","width":256},{"text":"what is the first thing that we said before","width":64},{"text":"I have to make sure that I dont want","width":128},{"text":"so I want to make sure that I dont overwrite data","width":512},{"text":"that has already been written to","width":192},{"text":"so my producer is producing","width":192},{"text":"so Im putting things in","width":192},{"text":"but do I have to stop yet?","width":192},{"text":"No","width":64},{"text":"I can stop here","width":192},{"text":"but","width":64},{"text":"can I keep going?","width":128},{"text":"no.","width":64},{"text":"I have to make sure that I dont","width":192},{"text":"oops","width":64},{"text":"thats in","width":64},{"text":"I have to make sure that","width":192},{"text":"I dont overflow my buffers","width":128},{"text":"and now","width":64},{"text":"for the output","width":256},{"text":"for the consumer","width":128},{"text":"the consumer is going to start taking things out","width":384},{"text":"say it gets here","width":128},{"text":"he can still take that out","width":192},{"text":"but now it takes the last one out","width":256},{"text":"and now my out is here","width":256},{"text":"can it take anything out anymore","width":256},{"text":"?","width":64},{"text":"no","width":64},{"text":"if my program allowed the consumer","width":256},{"text":"to take something out at this point","width":448},{"text":"Id call that underflow","width":128},{"text":"Overflow means that","width":64},{"text":"my producer produces too much","width":64},{"text":"and overwrites the data","width":192},{"text":"and underflow","width":64},{"text":"is that my consumer tries to take out the data","width":384},{"text":"thats not there","width":128},{"text":"theres no underflow","width":192},{"text":"and theres no overflow","width":192},{"text":"I know you guys have done semaphores","width":384},{"text":"and I know you guys have done","width":384},{"text":"conditioned variables","width":64},{"text":"were going to implement","width":64},{"text":"a solution for a ring buffer","width":128},{"text":"and of course we have a number of properies","width":320},{"text":"we want to be able to have true","width":256},{"text":"we dont want to have any particuar decision waiting","width":512},{"text":"particular busy waiting","width":64},{"text":"so we want to make sure that our semephores","width":384},{"text":"and conditioned variables","width":192},{"text":"are set up correctly","width":64},{"text":"and","width":64},{"text":"we dont want to ","width":128},{"text":"have any kind of deadlock","width":192},{"text":"I know you guys havent talked specifically about what deadock means","width":832},{"text":"but at a mimum","width":64},{"text":"its going to mean","width":128},{"text":"that somebody cant move forward","width":192},{"text":"so we want to be able to look at both these things","width":384},{"text":"and we want an implementation that can do that","width":320},{"text":"first solution","width":128},{"text":"Im going to give you ","width":128},{"text":"my basic solution ","width":128},{"text":"and from there","width":128},{"text":"Ive bee told you guys like to sit down","width":448},{"text":"and come up with your own solutions right?","width":256},{"text":"let me put this back up there now","width":192},{"text":"so...","width":64},{"text":"how do you zoom on this thing","width":512},{"text":"oh there it is","width":192},{"text":"okay","width":128},{"text":"let me know if thats good enough for you","width":448},{"text":"Im going to give you a basic first start","width":256},{"text":"so what is the first thing that we need","width":320},{"text":"in our globals and initialized variables","width":256},{"text":"what are we trying to manage?","width":256},{"text":"Our buffer right?","width":192},{"text":"so we need a buffer","width":128},{"text":"so, Im going to have a","width":192},{"text":"and Im going to say","width":192},{"text":"Im just going to have a 16","width":320},{"text":"and then Im going to need the two variables","width":320},{"text":"what were the two variables I said we needed","width":64},{"text":"in and out","width":64},{"text":"since theyre just pointers into my data structure","width":512},{"text":"they can just be integers","width":128},{"text":"Ill have an integer in ","width":192},{"text":"and an integer out","width":128},{"text":"where should they both start?","width":192},{"text":"they start at the same place","width":384},{"text":"do we start them at different places","width":384},{"text":"do we start them at zero","width":192},{"text":"what should be do?","width":128},{"text":"we are going to initialize both in ","width":320},{"text":"to be zero ","width":128},{"text":"and my out to be zero","width":256},{"text":"so Im going to give you a basic enqueue","width":384},{"text":"and I want you to tell me if this works","width":192},{"text":"so for my enqueue","width":128},{"text":"Im going to put something in....","width":192},{"text":"my value","width":128},{"text":"and Im going to put something in","width":64},{"text":"my value","width":256},{"text":"Im going to put my value in","width":192},{"text":"awhatever the int value is","width":256},{"text":"and incredmetn","width":256},{"text":"and my dequeue is ","width":192},{"text":"Im going to say ","width":128},{"text":"I have som results","width":64},{"text":"Im not gonna talk about my result","width":64},{"text":"cus Im going to use it later","width":64}]
