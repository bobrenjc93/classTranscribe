four two and one","width":384},{"text":"and so instead reading four turn and one think read write execute","width":384},{"text":"so what's this? this is change the mode bits of this particular file sandwich","width":512},{"text":"into","width":192},{"text":"read and write for me or the owner of sandwhich, read for the group, read for everybody else","width":576},{"text":"so if you're not in the group you're not me, you get the read, so you get to see the contents of sandwhich but you cant modify and you can't execute it","width":704},{"text":"what's uh 755?","width":320},{"text":"what permissions do I get or what permissions does the owner of the file get?","width":512},{"text":"read write execute, four two and one. everybody else gets what? read and execute","width":512},{"text":"So that's a very common way of setting permissions, there are other ways to do it","width":704},{"text":"uh you can do it symbollically so this means hey subtract the write permission from all three uh types of users","width":576},{"text":"uh this means subtract read and exewcute permission from the uh owner or other I forget I'll look it up","width":448},{"text":"personally I prefer the octal numbers","width":256},{"text":"what's wrong with the file that has the following permission?","width":512},{"text":"let's suppose on the file system you found a file that was owned by root","width":896},{"text":"and had those permissions?
