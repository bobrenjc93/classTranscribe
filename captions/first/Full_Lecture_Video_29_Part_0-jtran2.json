[{"text":"Alright. Good afternoon class. Where are you? There we go. Alright. Hi","width":448},{"text":"So uh last night I had some fun uh making this uh camera preview.","width":448},{"text":"Uh. Normally when you set up a camera preview in android uh ","width":256},{"text":"For speed, you don't get to see the bytes.","width":192},{"text":"You don't see the actual pixels.","width":128},{"text":"Here's why. Memory is really really slow and when you start looking images","width":320},{"text":"typically you're talking about uh a million bytes or more","width":192},{"text":"Uh and uh uhhhhhh working with that in in Java and copying it from buffer to buffer ","width":448},{"text":"is going to make any kind of preview mode very very slow","width":384},{"text":"Um just as an example, uh a typically CPU these days can execute about 215 instructions per","width":576},{"text":"Sorry 250 per instructions per main memory access","width":320},{"text":"Versus say level 1 where it can do about 4 instructions per main uh per level 1 cache access","width":512},{"text":"Right so uh I didn't want that thought I actually to get the bytes from the preview ","width":320},{"text":"and uh finally I finally got it working last night. So we'll be playing with this in uh","width":256},{"text":"section tomorrow.","width":128},{"text":"Uh","width":64},{"text":"Theeeeeeee plan,","width":192},{"text":"We'll see if I get it working and then if I can't then it's your turn","width":128},{"text":"Is to uh make a webserver that's part of this app","width":320},{"text":"So that the webserver actually is uhhh got a back end interface into an application","width":384},{"text":"This isn't quite as crazy as it sounds. In fact,","width":192},{"text":"many of programs now uh have an in built webserver so that you can interrogate ","width":448},{"text":"uhhh the current state of the program so","width":192},{"text":"for example if you're developing a game,","width":128},{"text":"You might consider a webserver as an alternative way in into the kinda back end of your your","width":448},{"text":"game engine so you could look at stats that the program is running","width":128},{"text":"you could change things as so as the program is running","width":320},{"text":"you could even build a complete a small interpreter so you could say quickly set where the","width":192},{"text":"uhhh where the players are or load a particular state file","width":256},{"text":"so that kind of thing","width":64},{"text":"I've seen it done with uh gas chromachaffs as well where there's a main screen","width":320},{"text":"and then there's a behind the scenes webserver which you can connect to ","width":128},{"text":"if you know the port and maybe a password","width":128},{"text":"Uh so again you can check the status of the engine or the program as it's running","width":320},{"text":"So as planned is can we make a webserver that is part of this camera preview","width":320},{"text":"and then we'll use it to actually share","width":128},{"text":"The image","width":64},{"text":"Alright so.","width":128},{"text":"We'll make our bit of kind of spyware so that anyone that knows the port number","width":320},{"text":"can actually look at the uh the current preview that's going on.","width":192},{"text":"right","width":64},{"text":"So that's what we're going to make. Ummm","width":192},{"text":"Now today, we're gonna talk about uhh files andd uhhh this kinda one really really really big idea","width":448},{"text":"and it's gonna this kind of misconception I want to clear up today","width":128},{"text":"that a file name is NOT a file","width":192},{"text":"and it's an easy trap that we get called into because we think like that all day long","width":256},{"text":"we think, open this file and here's the name","width":192},{"text":"Right","width":128},{"text":"If you could walk out of this lecture","width":128},{"text":"Not believing that anymore, then, you made significant progress","width":320},{"text":"Instead what I want you to think of isss","width":128},{"text":"The file is an i node","width":128},{"text":"That, a file is just the bytes, just the content","width":320},{"text":"Forget for a moment that it has a name","width":128},{"text":"Forget that it lives inside a directory","width":192},{"text":"Forget that it lives inside a hierarchy","width":192},{"text":"That's all icing the cake, which we're gonna do seperately from the actual file","width":448},{"text":"Right. So how do we think of files?","width":320},{"text":"Think of them as just a particular inode","width":256},{"text":"and remember this is how we're going to organize our space on the disk","width":192},{"text":"Where we initially format it, uhh we'll have a super block","width":256},{"text":"SUPER BLOCK","width":64},{"text":"But the super block is just a managed information about how we've actually organized this data","width":384},{"text":"And in fact on real disks, disk information is so critical to be able to get anything done","width":320},{"text":"It's actually replicated several times throughout the disk ","width":128},{"text":"Just in case uh we get um a cosmic ray or some other effect which obliterates this particular copy","width":384},{"text":"But anyways super block tells us, how many say inodes we've got","width":192},{"text":"and and where the very first data block block starts","width":192},{"text":"Right. So. If we're using an inode. That means we've stored a file on our disk","width":448},{"text":"And remember we looked at last time that each inode might have some","width":256},{"text":"Direct entries","width":64},{"text":"HEY here's the content","width":64},{"text":"and we'll have say about ten of those","width":192},{"text":"But if we want to store larger files,","width":256},{"text":"Then the game we play is we store a reference a data block that is not actually used for data","width":320},{"text":"It's used just to hold pointers to actually data blocks","width":192},{"text":"And if we have a larger file, we play this game twice","width":192},{"text":"we have now, a reference to a data block","width":128},{"text":"That it to itself contains pointers to yet more tables of pointers","width":256},{"text":"And then finally huge file, ","width":192},{"text":"Then we play this game three times, thriple indirection block","width":192},{"text":"and that's it, we don't play after that. Right? We don't try to. We don't have quad indirection blocks","width":320},{"text":"Right so that's our contents of our inodes","width":128},{"text":"and you remember that inodes have more than just these pointers, ","width":256},{"text":"they have a little bit of information as well, a little meta information like the file size","width":192},{"text":"ummm, ahhh who owns the file.","width":192},{"text":"And as we'll see in a little bit","width":256},{"text":"Guess what? you could basically, from C,","width":192},{"text":"Discover what's in the inode.","width":192},{"text":"And uh.","width":128},{"text":"Including the inode number,","width":192},{"text":"And remember we talked about some of these things like,","width":256},{"text":"Who saw it, when was it last accessed, when was it last modified?","width":192},{"text":"When it last changed?","width":64},{"text":"And","width":192},{"text":"Total number of bytes","width":192}]
