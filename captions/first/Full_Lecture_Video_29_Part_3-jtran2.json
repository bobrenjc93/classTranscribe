It actually all of the entries","width":448},{"text":"and remember how we said that we actually dot and dot dot","width":192},{"text":"yes, there they are, they're the first two entries  that we actually will see when we ","width":320},{"text":"iterate through the contents of my directory","width":128},{"text":"so i could start making this into a more useful program, I could start finding things","width":320},{"text":"uh for example, uh","width":192},{"text":"instead of just dot, i could actually make use of uhh the","width":256},{"text":"uhhm main. alright this could be for example uh argv(1)","width":384},{"text":"For now i've got a program that's a bit like DIR it's starting to look for things inside a certain directory","width":832},{"text":"okay right, so what's the error in this code?","width":192},{"text":"Yessss.
