okay right so let's do today","width":320},{"text":"so I hear you talked about [gibberish] yes? last week with Robin? yeah","width":768},{"text":"we're going to continue thinking about deadlock today but I'm also going to give you some hints about the next MP","width":576},{"text":"which is to make a fast merge sort, a multithreaded merge sort","width":384},{"text":"so first of all let's review a little problem here","width":448},{"text":"and see what we can remember about the coffman conditions","width":704},{"text":"I've got three gardeners walking into a garden shed to start their work","width":704},{"text":"they are after some resources right and so they are going to pick up their tools for the day","width":384},{"text":"in other words they are about to request some resources","width":192},{"text":"obviously we have a potential for a deadlock, we might have two gardeners try to pick up the same shovel or something","width":448},{"text":"okay fortunately we know about coffman conditions","width":192},{"text":"alright so how can we assure that we are avoid deadlock","width":320},{"text":"I want you to through the [something] time remember yes there are four coffman conditions","width":384},{"text":"now here's the challenge, can you actually write down at least one of them","width":256},{"text":"or better, can between you and your neighbor actually write all four without looking them up","width":576},{"text":"make a list, make a list of four items, see if you can remember what they are","width":128},{"text":"what are the conditions for deadlock?

write it all down","width":256},{"text":"throw that piece of paper away, do it again on a different day","width":256},{"text":"you're telling your brain this stuff is important to me I need to access stuff","width":192},{"text":"right what have we got?","width":192},{"text":"okay first of all let's see give me a hands up if you managed to get at least one","width":576},{"text":"okay hands up if you've got at least two","width":192},{"text":"hands up if you've got three","width":64},{"text":"hands up if you've got four","width":128},{"text":"alright hands up if you haven't... ah nvm, nice let's keep going","width":320},{"text":"here's one we should know right? mutual exclusion","width":256},{"text":"exclusive access","width":192},{"text":"we need non sharable resources","width":448},{"text":"in other words, if my gardeners are all friendly and they say oh no no let's all use this shovel together","width":640},{"text":"then there won't be any deadlock","width":256},{"text":"but instead of course they're like no I'm grabbing this shovel and get your own","width":512},{"text":"so first of all we need access","width":128}]
