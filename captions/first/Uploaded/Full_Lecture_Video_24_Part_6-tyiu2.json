[{"text":"what's wrong with that?","width":448},{"text":"ok, if a process runs forever, or one homework is really hard, you taking cs 473, you think 241 is hard, ha! wait till you take 473","width":576},{"text":"right, or take 373. anyway, the three hundred class, now, the i may not get to some short jobs quickly, right? if this job over here is just Hey, send all those email, they reply, you can have to wait a long time, even though it's gonna take a minute for you to complete this job, i've got a very slow quantum","width":1472},{"text":"so this is sorts of streams, I got one way where i got to introduce a lot of overhead, because of the context switch, another, where short jobs are now waiting for a very very long time, to be accessed","width":1024},{"text":"so what do we do? on a real system. on, say a lap top, or on your linux. where for starters i'm gonna talk about linux just a sec cuz linux is [gibberish]","width":704},{"text":"we gotta choose an appropriate quantum","width":128},{"text":"and you will see times, typical times of ten to hendred milliseconds","width":384},{"text":"in other words, a little hardware clock goes of says, hey, your time's up","width":512},{"text":"and interrupts the cpu, and kernel gets involved and say \"hey, time to move onto a different job\"","width":320},{"text":"why do you think we chose ten to a hundred milliseconds","width":512},{"text":"its empirical. yes, so in what factors, what factors influence that decision","width":1088},{"text":"ok we got a lot of things running in parallel, we've got interactive jobs, you typing on a terminal, for example, and as you type, you want the letters to appear. if we context switch, if we go off to a different problem, many times a second, you won't know. people won't know that they are sharing the cpu with multiple jobs","width":1408},{"text":"right? you could be logging into a server, or you could be typing in a terminal, and it looks like \"hey, the system is mine\"","width":384},{"text":"the cpu is all mine to play with, and if we keep swapping it around fast enough, no one except for the people taking cs241 will know","width":576},{"text":"no one will know that actually we keep swapping the cpu ","width":192},{"text":"so that's the first idea to why we choose to this kind of time","width":256},{"text":"which is its not so short that we have a lot of overhead, but its short enough so that our system appears to be responsive","width":640},{"text":"when we interact with it","width":128},{"text":"these days you might see even faster times as well","width":192},{"text":"right, and finally, what does linux do today, it uses something called ... oops ... a completely fair scheduler","width":1024},{"text":"ok","width":256},{"text":"some comments about this, one is, huh, there is no such things as someone could be completely fair.
