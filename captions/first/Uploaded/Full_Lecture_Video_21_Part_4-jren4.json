the pen that wouldn't fly","width":384},{"text":"thank you, yes, we've run out of address space","width":384},{"text":"but this is the dominant way, today 95% of the internet traffic is still ip version 4","width":640},{"text":"so we have some tricks, we can hide a whole load of machines behind just a few ip addresses for example","width":448},{"text":"we can have multiple websites hosted on the same machine","width":256},{"text":"and so they all share the same ip address","width":192},{"text":"but we've got a problem, this initial specification of saying every device just had a ipv4 address is no longer sufficient","width":576},{"text":"so we'll be going over to ip6 slowly","width":256},{"text":"the protocol is already out but today ip version 6 accounts for less than 5% of the internet traffic","width":384},{"text":"we'll talk more about the actual details of ip version 4 after spring break","width":384},{"text":"so let's instead talk about a very special place, anybody going home for spring break?","width":384},{"text":"yes! great this is where you're going","width":192},{"text":"okay, so 127.0.0.1 is a very special place in our hearts","width":384},{"text":"it is the ip address of your local host","width":192},{"text":"your home machine, so if you try and send a packet here, it doesn't have very far to go","width":320},{"text":"next time you find a script kiddie on the internet, tell them to hack this ip address","width":448},{"text":"right so it's very very common, every system programmer knows this address","width":448},{"text":"if you set up a server for example and you want to test it","width":320},{"text":"you might want to try and open this address in your web browser to say okay connect to the server on this very machine","width":384},{"text":"alright so rooting this address is this trivial, it doesn't even need to go to the network port","width":576},{"text":"the kernel will notice that hey I'm trying to talk to myself and not bother to actually craft any electrical pulses on the wire, it doesn't actually leave your machine","width":704},{"text":"and you can use this on a virtual machine or a real machine etc etc etc","width":256},{"text":"so this is your local host","width":192},{"text":"you can even buy door mats that say there is no place like 127.0.0.1","width":1088},{"text":"okay so that's your first ip address, fantastic!","width":384},{"text":"most people don't remember many ip addresses but they know that one and they might know an ip address for the dns server but more about that after break","width":768},{"text":"instead let's talk about a port","width":192},{"text":"so we're going to send some electrical pulses, some bits, down the wire and hopefully it will arrive at the other end","width":640},{"text":"at the machine of our choice","width":64},{"text":"so once it gets there we have to say well what are we going to do with these bits","width":320},{"text":"who are they for?","width":64},{"text":"so the idea is to think of a port, like a C port where things arrive","width":448},{"text":"we won't give them character names though","width":320},{"text":"we'll just give them numbers","width":128},{"text":"so on the outside of our packet, we'll say hey this data is going to go to machine whatever","width":448},{"text":"one hundred and twenty three point one blah blah blah","width":256},{"text":"and I want to go to a particular port","width":192},{"text":"so our packets then have thirty two bits or four octets","width":320},{"text":"hey look, here's an octet octet octet so in other words we can choose numbers","width":320},{"text":"between zero and two hundred and fifty five","width":448},{"text":"I just made this ip address up","width":128},{"text":"so this is our ip address","width":256},{"text":"four times eight bits or four octets","width":320},{"text":"but we also need a port number","width":192},{"text":"and port numbers use sixteen bits","width":576},{"text":"why? it seemed like enough at the time","width":256},{"text":"and eight bits didn't seem to be enough","width":128},{"text":"these are fairly arbitrary decisions back in the nineteen seventies and earlier","width":384},{"text":"to say well we know that we think that this internet thing is going to get big","width":448},{"text":"and if we have this many bits, then hopefully we can have different processes listening to different port numbers","width":576},{"text":"and that's the basic idea","width":256}]
