[{"text":"so yes you can see starvation with this systems","width":320},{"text":"so we gonna look at these terms and we are going to umm analyze different schedulers","width":384},{"text":"right, so this a few common schedulers and next week on wednesday we are going to look at these in detail and run some examples through them","width":832},{"text":"fcfs, right, when i call it fcfs because in literature we see these things so commonly shortened because its a bit of mouthful","width":832},{"text":"first come first served","width":320},{"text":"so this is the mcdonalds scheduler","width":384},{"text":"you arrive first, i serve you first. its a queue, right","width":192},{"text":"its a simple queue. you put your homeworks in the order that they arrive. ","width":448},{"text":"is that a good thing?","width":256},{"text":"uhh it depends, we gonna have to think about whether these schedulers good for batched jobs or for [gibberish] because we actually have our user that wants to see progress on their work","width":1088},{"text":"so we have first come first served","width":128},{"text":"in other words , its just a queue","width":512},{"text":"right, the next scheduling is , its fantastic, here it is","width":704},{"text":"shortest job first","width":320},{"text":"now, we can use this, we can analyze our scheduler mathematically","width":448},{"text":"in practice you might run into a bit of problem if you try to actually implement shortest job first. whats the probleml","width":640},{"text":"ya, how do you know, [gibberish]","width":320},{"text":"and become clairvoyant and steals some tacheons from physics lab, and simply know in the future, how long your job is going to run","width":768},{"text":"now ok some specialized circumstances, you might be able to do that. for example, if you ran exactly the same program yesterday, and you are running the same code, with the same kind of data today, you can be pretty confident that your job is gonna take two hours to run","width":960},{"text":"but in a genial system that is not true. we dont know how long our jobs gonna run","width":640},{"text":"but we can still at least analyze this. if we have some fake data, say, job1 takes 10 minutes to complete, or 2 hours to complete, we can still do some analysis. so shortest job first in practice ... [cant hear] difficult to implement because you dont know how long it is","width":1280},{"text":"right","width":128},{"text":"ahh haa, this is the pirate one, its the round robin","width":640},{"text":"now this might sound like a kind of quint english thing and we dance around and jib with some medieval music ","width":832},{"text":"that would be an incorrect answer","width":384},{"text":"round robin, heres the idea, is that all of you are important, so im gonna spend a bit of time with each of you","width":512},{"text":"alright i set my clock, i talk to you a minute, and bye","width":192},{"text":"i talk to you a minute, and bye, i talk to you a minute, and bye, now of course i'm the cpu, right, we are talking abotu the cpu giving resource to meet these jobs, so imagine like if i got all of these hoemwork, all of these stuff that my cpu can be doing, i'm going through all of these processes, and they got the cpu for a minute, and lets say, youre the last job, yes well we gonna go around again","width":1792},{"text":"ok","width":256},{"text":"so you can see if this say for fun all of these jobs has three minutes of cpu to complete, ","width":640},{"text":"ok","width":128},{"text":"none of them complete within three mintues, ok i'm gonna keep going through. these got a little slot of time, so thats why we call it round robin. now it turns out that this homework, half way through, has some problem on it that cant be completed, without additional information from the professor","width":1536},{"text":"so the cpu say, youare blocked, you are waiting for ... function that, so i'll skip you. you are not actually runnable at this point","width":448},{"text":"so our scheduler only needs to run jobs which are not blocked. ","width":384},{"text":"so for example, if you just wrote you server code and your calling accept, we dont need to spend any cpu time on that process. its blocked, theres nothing for it to compute. ","width":896},{"text":"anyway, thats round robin","width":192},{"text":"so the idea is that we have a little piece of time and you get it and you get the cpu for certain amount of time","width":1152},{"text":"of course it might be that if i give you thirty seconds, hey i've done already","width":320},{"text":"nothing more for you to do. you 've finished copyinbg data to the disk, you just called accept, you just called mutex lock and youre waiting for it to finish. ","width":512},{"text":"uhh so your process might give up the cpu before you minute is up","width":512},{"text":"before you time pointer expires, but if you dont, ha, too bad for you, i'm taking the cpu away from you, and i'm assigning it to a different process","width":832},{"text":"so your little process is now stuck in time","width":256},{"text":"your homework is half finished because the cpu is working on a different job. ","width":320},{"text":"right, preemptive scheduling. ok, this is easy, if our jobs, if our task have different priorities, hey, system programs is really important to me, and i'm going to get this done before anything else, then we can use that as a scheduling decision","width":1600},{"text":"so lets go back to round robin for a moment, and say how long shuold our time quantum to be? all that tradeoffs","width":1024},{"text":"ok, lets turn that into a homework problem again. suppose that we work on this problem for ten seconds, and then this homework for 10 seconds, and then this homework with 10 seconds, and then this homework has 10 seconds ","width":896},{"text":"what s the disadvantage? yes?","width":320},{"text":"","width":128},{"text":"thank you! i'm doing a lot of context switch. I'm going to spend a lot of time, actual ... time, real time, just switching one problem to the next problem","width":640},{"text":"so much so and now i've introduced some latency into the system, so much so that um my throughput is no longer good, its because actual cpu time is burned is spent doing all these context switches","width":1216},{"text":"okay, so lets go to the other extreme than. I'm going to work on this homework for a day","width":448},{"text":"and then i'm going to work on another homework for another day","width":64},{"text":"and the next day, so i've made my time quantum very very large now","width":320}]
