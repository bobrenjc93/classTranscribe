## Follow the following consistency guidelines
1. When transcribing terms... ask yourself: If you were to search for this term, what would you search for? Then write that term down. (ie. write "printf" instead of "print f")
2. Generally don't worry about capitalization. Use punctuation as you see fit.
3. Write out "non-technical numbers" as words. Write out "technical numbers" as numbers. ie. “Print hello six times” and “There are 8 bits in a byte”.

## When you are finished, click "Submit Transcription"
