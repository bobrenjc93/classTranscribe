## 7. Follow the following consistency guidelines
* When transcribing terms... ask yourself: If I were to search for this term, what would I search for? Then write that term down. (ie. write "printf" instead of "print f")
* Generally don't worry about capitalization. Use punctuation as you see fit.
* Write out "non-technical numbers" as words. Write out "technical numbers" as numbers. ie. “Print hello six times” and “There are 8 bits in a byte”.
* If you can't understand a certain speech segment, just fill it with some placeholder ie. [gibberish] and move on.

## 8. When you are finished, click "Submit Transcription" [IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT]
