that are noteworthy here is first of all they have different sizes","width":303},{"text":"so let's look at the sizes of each of these, perhaps you can guess what the result is going to be","width":405},{"text":"so you'll see the size of the pointer is the number of bytes to actually hold the character pointer","width":307},{"text":"which as this is a 32-bit machine is four bytes","width":226},{"text":"the size of array is the total size required to hold the whole array","width":420},{"text":"so when this code runs it's actually going to copy the contents of that string literal \"hello world\" into the new array object","width":564},{"text":"so in this case we need twelve bytes for that, eleven for \"hello world\" plus a twelfth to hold the null character at the end the bit pattern zero to say okay we've reached the end of the string","width":769},{"text":"their sizes is very different, plus remember that because we've made additional memory on the stack","width":496},{"text":"we can change it so I can change it to \"jello world\" for example","width":272},{"text":"let's start manipulating our string","width":234},{"text":"we'll do this on our array so we can actually make modifications to it","width":240},{"text":"how about we change all the 'l's to a different letter","width":242},{"text":"so we'll change and we'll pass the beggining of the array","width":255},{"text":"so let's pass in the array and afterwards we'll print what the array is so that's %s","width":985},{"text":"alright so I'll have my function called change down here and it takes a pointer to that memory","width":378},{"text":"so we don't need to return anything because we are actually going to be using the parameter to point to some memory that we are going to change","width":506},{"text":"what can we do with this?","width":121},{"text":"well let's have a little loop that says while(p) that says while p is non zero","width":433},{"text":"actually what we care about is whether p is pointing to memory that holds zero","width":316},{"text":"in other words, we've reached the end of the string","width":142},{"text":"we want to follow the pointer we want to dereference the pointer and for that we need the asterisk","width":290},{"text":"okay so what should we do with this. well we could change all of the letters","width":429},{"text":"for example we could blank it out","width":173},{"text":"we could say star p equals","width":147},{"text":"and it might be tempting to write an astericks here","width":376},{"text":"but that's not right because the

let's see if my p is, at when I look at that memory location, whether it's a lowercase l","width":594},{"text":"and as I said before because we are working with characters it is ok to compare them so note the use of double equals here","width":553},{"text":"okay so let's run that","width":341},{"text":"we have a couple of errors here","width":204},{"text":"for starters we're not using pointer","width":150},{"text":"so I can comment out that line","width":111},{"text":"I've got another problem here which is that change is implicitly declared","width":289},{"text":"that's because we haven't declared what the function signature of change() looks like","width":301},{"text":"let's do that now","width":89},{"text":"I'm going to say later on compiler, I expect to actually define a function and I'll give you the actual code to create this change method","width":700},{"text":"but for now here is what it's signature looks like","width":153},{"text":"it's called change, it takes a pointer to a character and it doesn't return anything","width":272},{"text":"so if I compile that now my warnings should go away","width":283},{"text":"great so I've got a function that can walk through","width":402},{"text":"I could have another function that finds letters as well","width":186},{"text":"so for example suppose we wanted to find the first o in this","width":503},{"text":"I could change this so that rather than changing the letters","width":413},{"text":"if the contents of p is an 'o', let's return p","width":466},{"text":"now I'm going to change my method signature","width":243},{"text":"and I'd better have a return value that returns something if I get to the very end","width":338},{"text":"so for example, it returns where p is","width":324},{"text":"we can now update my original code so that it finds the first 'o' and gives you back a pointer to that","width":876},{"text":"if I print that out","width":93},{"text":"hopefully you can guess what my program should do","width":407},{"text":"okay so it gave us back a string and it this time the pointer was half way through \"hello world\"","width":453},{"text":"that's OK, our pointers don't care what they point to","width":278},{"text":"we know that strings will continue until we reach the null byte at the

Let's talk about automatic variables","width":204},{"text":"so here's my main method I've got two function calls f1 f2","width":328},{"text":"and today I'm going to actually define them before my main method","width":266},{"text":"so I don't need to put in the additional declares in","width":211},{"text":"so let's have f1 here and f2...ok","width":353},{"text":"so now I've got a syntactically correct program","width":257},{"text":"but I want to talk about the variables that we might put inside these","width":182},{"text":"so if I create a variable like this to say \"hey I've got a value here, something I need to compute inside f1\" or maybe I want to make an array","width":718},{"text":"so here's my array and I can initialize it to, say, \"f1f1\" here we go","width":529},{"text":"then the lifetime of my array (this variable) is only for the lifetime of the function","width":456},{"text":"when I return from f1, then the variable goes out of scope","width":307},{"text":"which means the name \"array\" doesn't mean anything anymore inside our program","width":271},{"text":"but secondly, the memory that we were using for the array is automatically free'd up","width":298},{"text":"it can be reused for other purposes in a moment by the rest of the program","width":197},{"text":"so isn't that fantastic","width":131},{"text":"that's why it's called an automatic variable","width":160},{"text":"so automatic variables are very easy to use","width":140},{"text":"they also come with a big warning sticker and that's this","width":273},{"text":"which is to be very wary of just how long they live for","width":440},{"text":"let's do a couple of things here","width":126},{"text":"first of all, let's make it so that we can actually see the pointer in memory where array is pointing to","width":671},{"text":"so, let's print that out inside our function here","width":341},{"text":"remember that the name of the array (when converted to address) gives us the very beginning of the array","width":400},{"text":"and, we'll do that for our second function too","width":172},{"text":"okay, so, f2 f2","width":220},{"text":"just to prove that they're making different arrays","width":215},{"text":"okay, so we'll compile and run this","width":190},{"text":"and, when we run it, we see that both f1 and f2 both these functions the array is actually stored inside the same memory location","width":864},{"text":"isn't that fantastic. we didn't need any additional memory","width":155},{"text":"and that's because after we return from f1, any of those automatic variables are free'd so they are no longer needed so we can reuse that space","width":598},{"text":"internally, later we'll discover that a stack data structure is used to implement this","width":497},{"text":"and I can show a little bit of this by having a either a recursive function or we can make another function call these","width":611},{"text":"so for example, I could have a function called eg","width":421},{"text":"and, this calls f1","width":146},{"text":"so now let's have a look in the case that I'm not using f2 anymore","width":363},{"text":"so that can go away","width":180},{"text":"instead, I've got a function called eg and that can say have its own space","width":365},{"text":"so, blah and maybe say a thousand and twenty four bytes here","width":571},{"text":"and then we call f1 again","width":142},{"text":"so let's run this now","width":474},{"text":"so, in the output, you'll see that f1 is printed twice and the second time it's because it's being called from our function eg","width":784},{"text":"and in this case, it's further down in the stack. it's in lower memory","width":348},{"text":"f948 as opposed to fd50","width":154},{"text":"because it's being called from eg","width":335},{"text":"so, we'll see more about the stack in a moment","width":162},{"text":"later on. I just wanted to show you that they really are stored in different places","width":326},{"text":"finally, to reinforce this idea, let's make a little recursive function","width":348},{"text":"so, I can have something which takes an integer say I'll call it \"level\"","width":488},{"text":"and if level is greater than zero, let's call ourselves again with a slightly reduced value","width":667},{"text":"and I can of course make that simpler by just saying \"if level\"","width":272},{"text":"so if level is nonzero, then call it again","width":125},{"text":"and let's call it with say five","width":178},{"text":"okay, a semicolon would help","width":303},{"text":"each case as we go deeper and deeper into recursion, our array is getting lower and lower and lower in memory","width":587},{"text":"so we have all of these arrays created. all of these different activation records in different places","width":370},{"text":"inside our processes's memory","width":181},{"text":"so the last point we'll make, which is the most important, which is that it's very dangerous to return pointers to memory that is no longer valid","width":472},{"text":"for example, rather than returning nothing returning void, suppose we try to return a pointer to our array","width":659},{"text":"then though this code might compile, okay, I can get rid of \"level\" now","width":557},{"text":"it's certainly not a valid program because the pointer we get back from f1 now points to stale memory","width":631},{"text":"that memory is no longer ours to control","width":167},{"text":"it will be used in a moment for other function calls","width":182},{"text":"so always be careful if you are returning a pointer to something. make sure that that memory is still valid","width":413},{"text":"and never return a pointer to an automatic variable","width":208},{"text":"that's it for me. time for you to play. bye!","width":187}],

  [{"text":"hi welcome","width":116},{"text":"so we have got a little function so far called currenttime()","width":136},{"text":"that requests 128 bytes from the heap","width":307},{"text":"and then providing we get a non-null pointer back from malloc","width":263},{"text":"we will copy in the time 2:51 PM into that memory","width":288},{"text":"and then return a pointer to the first byte of that memory so that's our little currenttime","width":262},{"text":"we've been careful to make sure that if malloc fails, perhaps our program has used all of the heap memory","width":411},{"text":"then we don't try to use that null pointer","width":207},{"text":"but now let's actually make it so that it actually makes a call to find out what the current time is","width":540},{"text":"the current time is known by the system","width":114},{"text":"so it's time to make a system call and then we will format that using a c function called ctime()","width":529},{"text":"to actually give us a human readable version of the time","width":328},{"text":"both of these functions can be found inside the include time.h","width":306},{"text":"I've commented them up here","width":113},{"text":"so the first think we can do is call time so when you call time you can pass it a pointer to a time_t variable","width":717},{"text":"or you can say actuall I'm not going to give you anything and it will still give you back the time in its result","width":512},{"text":"so let's just use the result","width":145},{"text":"so here's the number of seconds since 1970","width":534},{"text":"we'll store that inside our little variable called secondsSince1970","width":359},{"text":"but I don't want that as a value, I just want to turn that into a string","width":224},{"text":"for that there's a function called ctime, this a library function. there are other functions that give greater control to the precise formatting","width":630},{"text":"but for this demo let's just use ctime() which has some reasonable formatting that most people can understand","width":617},{"text":"this will give us back a pointer to the time","width":319},{"text":"so the time in ASCII, in otherwords in letters, in readable time","width":484},{"text":"and then we can use that and copy that result into new memory, into our result","width":526},{"text":"so one problem with ctime() is that it uses static storage","width":339},{"text":"in other words it's great if you just want to call it once, and it will use it's static storage to give you back the time in a readable format","width":674},{"text":"but don't expect that to stay around because if you call ctime() again in the future it is going to overwrite those bytes","width":455},{"text":"and that's why our little function here called currenttime() is useful","width":200},{"text":"we are going to take that temporary result and put it into some memory that is ours to control","width":403},{"text":"so it can't be overwritten","width":174},{"text":"we need to pass in seconds since midnight","width":223},{"text":"except we've got a problem here","width":208},{"text":"it doesn't actually want the value, it wants a pointer to this variable, it wants to know where in memory this variable is","width":554},{"text":"for that I have to introduce some new syntax, which is the &","width":270},{"text":"when you see & it means that I don't want to know about the variable itself, but where it is stored in memory","width":523},{"text":"tell me the address of the variable","width":305},{"text":"we didn't need this for arrays because that's what the array name gives us automatically","width":224},{"text":"but for other items we can use the & to find out where it is stored in memory","width":500},{"text":"let's compile and run it","width":374},{"text":"and we find out that my little virtual machine thinks it's Jan 1 2014","width":389},{"text":"not very accurate, we should probably change it, but it did print out what it thinks the current time","width":487},{"text":"I promised you that I'd mention a few more mistakes that we can make with heap memory","width":479},{"text":"one mistake we can make is to double free the same pointer","width":423},{"text":"this can lead to all sorts of horrendous problems because when you tell the heap that you've freed with some memory it might actually use that memory for it's own book keeping","width":719},{"text":"so it knows that the particular block of memory is free","width":275},{"text":"if you free it again it can confuse the book keeping, the pointers that the heap is using itself","width":684},{"text":"once we've freed some memory, dont free it by accident a second time!","width":208},{"text":"another common mistake in C programs is to continue using memory after we've freed it","width":536},{"text":"we shouldn't consider that memory to be valid anymore","width":175},{"text":"perhaps it's going to be reused by some other part of the program that is about to call malloc()","width":458},{"text":"and certainly we shouldn't expect anything that we've previously stored in there to be valid","width":469},{"text":"once we've freed it don't try to use the pointer again","width":188},{"text":"so for example, this would be an error","width":217},{"text":"so how can we guard against some of these errors?","width":199},{"text":"one common defensive programming technique is once we free a pointer set that pointer to be NULL","width":498},{"text":"to mean that I'm not pointing to anything anymore","width":212},{"text":"so this avoids the problem of what is called a dangling pointer error","width":429},{"text":"that now our pointer is no longer pointing to invalid memory","width":541},{"text":"that's it for me. time for you

value","width":297},{"text":"in addition to the next pointer","width":129},{"text":"the pointer to the next link","width":106},{"text":"okay so let's make some methods to create links and destroy them","width":440},{"text":"we'll do the create one first","width":123},{"text":"so it's going to return a pointer to a link","width":227},{"text":"and i might call it say link_create and I'll expect a key and I'll expect a value","width":721},{"text":"so that'll give me two pointers","width":159},{"text":"if i wish to debug this I could have a printf in here saying hey creating link and I could have what the key and values are for example","width":737},{"text":"right so i need to get some memory","width":165},{"text":"let's get some memory from the heap because we want our link to last for a long time until we decide to destroy it","width":445},{"text":"so i'll say malloc give me some memory and how much well i better ask for how big is my memory structure link_t","width":545},{"text":"and i will cast that return type as a pointer to my link object","width":445},{"text":"why do i do that","width":63},{"text":"well i want to be able to reference the sub parts","width":170},{"text":"the components of my struct","width":119},{"text":"and i will call that say result and i need to initialize my pointer","width":481},{"text":"so now i've got that I can set the key to be a key and the value to be the value","width":499},{"text":"now when i do this i am copying the pointers i'm not creating new strings","width":444},{"text":"so in other words i've now got a pointer called key and it's looking at exactly the same string array as the parameter is","width":499},{"text":"i haven't made any new string arrays","width":203},{"text":"so let's remember that when i return this","width":214},{"text":"that those pointers better be valid for the lifetime of the link","width":288},{"text":"well that's fine if I knew for example that this will always be used with string constants or I am taking control of those values that I send in and I happen to know that their lifetime is longer than the link's lifetime","width":1068},{"text":"so if that's the case then my code is relatively simple like this","width":214},{"text":"and destroying the link is also relatively simple","width":225},{"text":"so let's write a link destroy method destroy","width":205},{"text":"which takes a pointer to the link that is going to disappear so we can call that just p","width":437},{"text":"and what do i need to do in here","width":104},{"text":"well i can simply return the memory back","width":190},{"text":"okay so this works we could do a little better than this","width":253},{"text":"we could actually do some defensive programming here","width":150},{"text":"where we also destroy the information inside that link","width":381},{"text":"so for that i can use memory set","width":190},{"text":"so memset where I give it a pointer that I want to use","width":325},{"text":"the value will be zero the number of bytes can be the size of my link","width":279},{"text":"so this assures that i don't have any dangling pointers","width":258},{"text":"i have destroyed the key and value pointers","width":232},{"text":"i've set them back to null and anything else inside my link has been set to null","width":247},{"text":"so if someone happens to have a pointer to this link and they try to use the contents straight away then it will fail it will be null","width":521},{"text":"and secondly we are freeing it to say okay this memory can now be reused for other purposes","width":356},{"text":"so that's my link destroy method","width":158},{"text":"now suppose we discover that our strings we don't control the lifetime of these string arrays","width":483},{"text":"and that actually we should make copies of them","width":186},{"text":"so how can i do that","width":89},{"text":"well there's a method called strdup so let's do that strdup and this gives me back a pointer to a new string ","width":697},{"text":"a new character array that has been created on the heap","width":223},{"text":"and it's just a copy of that existing character array that we passed it","width":296},{"text":"so let's create our new string arrays and use those","width":296},{"text":"if we do that then when I destroy the link I better free up the memory associated with my key and value","width":470},{"text":"so before ending here I should free up those pointers","width":344},{"text":"so I should call free on my key and free on my value pointer as well","width":641},{"text":"okay so there's my code now to start working with a link","width":780},{"text":"with my main method I will need to always know the beginning of my linked list","width":448},{"text":"so that sounds like a great thing to actually have as a global variable here","width":312},{"text":"so let me have my link pointer here and I can call it root","width":327},{"text":"and so the first link I make I can initialize root to that","width":316},{"text":"to that very first link","width":157},{"text":"okay so that's it for now, it's now time for you to play with creating more links","width":389},{"text":"bye","width":70}],

std.io","width":232},{"text":"i can say give me a single character for example and why don't I just keep calling this","width":400},{"text":"so i could just say while getchar is not equal to a special constant called end of file (EOF) keep going around in a loop","width":590},{"text":"but if I actually want to print them out I better actually store the value of getchar","width":232},{"text":"so let's have an integer value called c and inside my while condition I'm actually going to assign the result into c","width":544},{"text":"so you'll often see this pattern inside systems programming where we take a systems call or a library call and we store the results inside a variable","width":643},{"text":"but because that may also signify an error condition or a termination condition we use it immediately to check inside part of a while loop or an if statement","width":641},{"text":"so we've got a little character loop here that is going to keep going until it gets to the end of the file","width":254},{"text":"so now I want to print it out","width":92},{"text":"guess what i can call putchar and we'll see that running ","width":217},{"text":"so let's run this little program","width":264},{"text":"ABCD","width":90},{"text":"it prints back ABCD","width":147},{"text":"okay so we don't have to display the character just as a character","width":273},{"text":"we can display it as a character an integer and hexdecimal values","width":255},{"text":"so let's use printf for that","width":94},{"text":"so I've got %c %d and %x for character integer and hexadecimal value","width":376},{"text":"alright so let's run this","width":324},{"text":"and you can see that the letter A corresponds to sixty five which is in hexadecimal forty one","width":385},{"text":"right so why don't we use our little program to print out the contents of another file","width":433},{"text":"so if I cat my source code I can see the contents of that","width":292},{"text":"great so I'm going to pipe it into my program","width":273},{"text":"so i'll do ./program and it reads every byte and prints it out as a character","width":526},{"text":"great so let's encrypt our file now so I'm going to modify our value of c if it's not a newline character","width":533},{"text":"so what we'll do is say if c is at least thirty two in other words at least a space an ascii space","width":470},{"text":"and if it is we will change the lowest bit","width":382},{"text":"we'll flip the lowest bit","width":61},{"text":"how can we do that","width":64},{"text":"let's xor it with one","width":169},{"text":"right and then we'll print it out","width":147},{"text":"okay so we'll run this","width":172},{"text":"CDE for example and it changed the C to a B","width":281},{"text":"and if I do 135 I get 024","width":254},{"text":"so to say that I've got to the end of the file when I'm just typing you by the way you can do control d","width":374},{"text":"now see this working on some actual source code","width":226},{"text":"so let's here some text my program.c and i'm going to pipe that into my program to use as its input","width":524},{"text":"and you can see great we've garbled the program","width":264},{"text":"so if I want to I can then take that output and pipe it into my program again","width":444},{"text":"so now i'm going to unencrypt it because i flipped the lowest bit back  ","width":259},{"text":"so we get back our source code","width":133},{"text":"so that's getchar and putchar i can also work with whole lines","width":372},{"text":"i can let's get rid of the loop here i can say puts hello or any pointer to a character array provided its terminated by a zero byte at the end","width":997},{"text":"and that is equivalent to printf by saying %s and \\n at the end","width":560},{"text":"so i've got some character pointer here","width":279},{"text":"right so it's a little bit shorter to type than writing printf","width":480},{"text":"there is the opposite which is to get some input","width":225},{"text":"but this has a problem and we'll see why in a moment why this function actually call is being removed from the c standard","width":392},{"text":"i'm talking about gets so let's call gets and we will have a little buffer here","width":648},{"text":"so let's put a little buffer on the stack here","width":187},{"text":"i'll make it twelve bytes today ","width":109},{"text":"and remember when we call gets with buffer if you use the array name you are talking about the very first byte of the array","width":432},{"text":"and rather than printing out hello","width":175},{"text":"we will print out our buffer value","width":137},{"text":"so let's run this and we can type something in and it echos it back to us","width":509},{"text":"fantastic but what happens if we enter more than twelve bytes","width":262},{"text":"so in other words could something bad happen to our other variables","width":247},{"text":"well yes it could because if we go past twelve bytes we start writing into memory which is used for other purposes","width":353},{"text":"for example in my little program the integer is immediately after the buffer","width":378},{"text":"let's prove this let's set our hex value of c to be ten twenty thirty fourty","width":422},{"text":"let me print that out after we've called gets i'm going to print it again","width":584},{"text":"so we've got to remember that what we store is going to be our letters plus a null byte","width":475},{"text":"so in this case if I do ABCDABCDABCD I've already overflowed because the thirteenth byte is now going to be written into my integer","width":796},{"text":"but i am going to do just a few more I'll do ABCD there we go","width":295},{"text":"and we'll see that I've managed to change my integer value to 41424344","width":412},{"text":"so the last ABC that I wrote in there actually overran my buffer","width":277},{"text":"i've got a buffer overflow and I've corrupted the contents of another variable","width":300},{"text":"so that's why gets is dangerous","width":107},{"text":"there's no way to tell gets that we shouldn't accept input that is too long for it","width":420},{"text":"so in a future video i'll tell you about getline and also fgets which don't suffer from these problems","width":586},{"text":"okay that's it for me thanks for watching and i'll see you in another video. bye!","width":269}],

  [{"text":"Hello! Let's talk about how we can use scanf and sscanf and fscanf to read some data and convert that into say integers or floats or strings","width":739},{"text":"so we can actually use those values inside our variables","width":232},{"text":"alright, so, I'll start by using sscanf","width":207},{"text":"which can parse data inside a string","width":184},{"text":"inside memory","width":109},{"text":"so for example, let's have a little bit of data here","width":136},{"text":"I'll have my data be my name and a score","width":454},{"text":"and I want to take that and pull it apart into a string and an integer","width":385},{"text":"so I'll have a little buffer here, say, up to twenty characters","width":343},{"text":"and a little integer here","width":102},{"text":"and I could set this to be equal to some arbitrary value. we'll see why in a little bit","width":434},{"text":"and then I'm going to say \"okay, sscanf please read from this string array and what I'd like you to do is convert that into a string followed by one or more spaces and then an integer value\"","width":1146},{"text":"alright so scanf is going to look at our memory starting at wherever our data is pointing at","width":359},{"text":"and, it's going to first of all look for a string until it comes across one space","width":357},{"text":"and then there can be actually multiple spaces in our data","width":155},{"text":"and then after that, it's going to treat the rest of the string as an integer","width":287},{"text":"okay, now, our format specifiers say the kind of data that we want to interpret and also the number of bytes that should be written to when it is trying to parse its data","width":730},{"text":"so we better tell it where to exactly put these things","width":154},{"text":"so for our string, we want it to write it into a buffer","width":234},{"text":"and for the score, we want to write it into our score variable","width":199},{"text":"but hold on a moment","width":114},{"text":"when we say \"buffer\" yes that gives us the beginning address of our array","width":372},{"text":"but not for score","width":63},{"text":"score is just going to give us whatever value score happens to hold","width":170},{"text":"in this case, negative forty two","width":124},{"text":"that's not what we need","width":69},{"text":"we actually want the address of this variable","width":132},{"text":"so we're going to say ampersand score","width":239},{"text":"so, lets read that and we'll print it out","width":271},{"text":"so here's the result and we'll say %s %d and we'll print the contents of the buffer and print the value of score","width":592},{"text":"so notice that scanf and printf, the arguments don't always look the same","width":266},{"text":"when we want to print out the values, we don't actually want to just print out the address of score","width":389},{"text":"we actually wanted to know what the value is","width":106},{"text":"great so that read that correctly","width":202},{"text":"scanf actually tells us something else which is how many arguments it correctly managed to parse","width":428},{"text":"so let's make a note of that and we'll print that out","width":299},{"text":"so, we'll say %d here","width":313},{"text":"print out the result in our printf statement here","width":183},{"text":"so now when we run it, we'll see that sscanf managed to read both iterms","width":384},{"text":"I got result two","width":90},{"text":"fantastic. so that's useful. now we can write robust programs to check if we really did write into both variables","width":521},{"text":"now you might be worried that scanf could result in a buffer overflow","width":286},{"text":"and, in fact, in our current code, you'd be right","width":168},{"text":"so if I had a very long name with no spaces here","width":419},{"text":"then that's longer than our buffer","width":229},{"text":"so what we need to do is tell scanf just how big our buffer is","width":209},{"text":"so in this case, it should be nineteen","width":207},{"text":"because we're setting scanf how many character to read from the input","width":321},{"text":"and our buffer, of course, if going to need one extra one to hold the terminating byte for this string","width":397},{"text":"so let's run this now","width":483},{"text":"and you'll see that first of all the name is truncated and that secondly, the return value of our scanf call here was one","width":538},{"text":"and it only managed to read into the buffer","width":259},{"text":"it gave up trying to read the integer because our buffer wasn't long enough","width":190},{"text":"and, in fact, our score variable still contained its original value","width":305},{"text":"of negative forty two","width":123},{"text":"so good defensive programs must check that the return value is reasonable","width":389},{"text":"also, when writing scanf or sscanf or fscanf, it's always a good idea to carefully check to see whether you should be looking at the address of the variable or if the variable itself actually is a pointer","width":783},{"text":"and is already going to give you the memory address that you'd like scanf to change","width":532},{"text":"alright so we've read data from a string ","width":263},{"text":"we can also parse data from a file stream and how can we do that? well you can use not sscanf but fscanf","width":663},{"text":"and if you did that, you better give it a file stream","width":182},{"text":"there's one called stdin already","width":209},{"text":"if we didn't want to use that, then we could open up a file using fopen and then pass in the file handle here","width":564},{"text":"and reading from stdin is such a common occurance that in fact there's another form of this which is just say scanf","width":699},{"text":"and if you do that, that means \"hey, just read from stdin\"","width":188},{"text":"so now, let's run our program here","width":555},{"text":"and, now it's waiting for input","width":99},{"text":"so let me typing something","width":130},{"text":"I'll say \"Angrave one hundred\"","width":324},{"text":"great! and it managed to parse both variables","width":177},{"text":"okay so that's enough introduction to scanf","width":188},{"text":"remember this next time you're trying to read 3d data and points and you want to say convert those ASCII numbers into actual floats and doubles","width":640},{"text":"and also remember that its important to read exactly how scanf uses these format specifiers because its not quite the same as printf","width":624},{"text":"alright, that's it for me. time for you to play. bye for now","width":278}],

  [{"text":"hello welcome","width":111},{"text":"let's talk about getline","width":93},{"text":"so it's very very common to read in a single line of text either from the user or from a file","width":438},{"text":"and we would like it to be very easy to say hey \"let's not worry about making sure my buffer is large enough\"","width":384},{"text":"I just want to get the whole line","width":95},{"text":"and thus getline was born","width":130},{"text":"this is being adopted into the posix standard","width":215},{"text":"if you are working however with older standard and an older compiler we have to ask gcc to explicitly enable it","width":463},{"text":"so before doing our includes with stdio we need to define _GNU_SOURCE","width":575},{"text":"so if we do that we would like the gnu source additions to the standard functions","width":473},{"text":"right so if we do that now we have got a getline declaration included as part of the #include <stdio.h>","width":478},{"text":"so here is how we can use getline","width":228},{"text":"with getline we actually set up two variables","width":284},{"text":"we get getline to manipulate these directly ","width":287},{"text":"we are going to have a pointer to a buffer","width":319},{"text":"and a little int to say how big is our buffer","width":369},{"text":"well let's just check to see really if it is an int or if we should be doing a different type","width":226},{"text":"so let me pull up my favorite manpage on getline","width":362},{"text":"see that actually the correct type to use is size_t","width":398},{"text":"which is essentially an unsigned int or larger on some systems","width":259},{"text":"so let's just make a note of that","width":99},{"text":"that is the declaration that we are going to be using","width":210},{"text":"and so we will have not just a buffer to our character array","width":377},{"text":"but also size as well to say how big is our buffer","width":328},{"text":"and i will call this say capacity","width":168},{"text":"right so we could start calling this and we could say okay","width":256},{"text":"get me a line and oh i need to pass in a pointer to my buffer variable","width":441},{"text":"right and notice that the declaration here is star star asteric so it's a pointer to a pointer","width":513},{"text":"right so how did i get that","width":97},{"text":"i say okay give me the address of my variable","width":223},{"text":"and similarly for the capacity as well","width":150},{"text":"the size of the variable","width":126},{"text":"so give me the address of my capacity","width":317},{"text":"and getline is going to modify those two variables directly","width":222},{"text":"essentially if my buffer is not large enough","width":189},{"text":"it is going to free up the old buffer and then call malloc so that we get a larger buffer","width":518},{"text":"okay technically it might call realloc but let's not worry about exactly which library call it calls","width":335},{"text":"we just know that it's going to do all that buffer maintenance for us automatically","width":266},{"text":"and now we need to give it a filestream so why don't we use say stdin","width":413},{"text":"now right now our code suffers from a terrible flaw which is that we've assumed that our automatic variables buffer capacity will be set to nothing","width":546},{"text":"so the getline knows that it can't reuse what it happens to be pointing to","width":264},{"text":"so we actually need to set these to explicitly to null and the capacity to zero","width":403},{"text":"so the first time we call getline getline will see that the buffer is certainly not large enough and will allocate enough space","width":502},{"text":"we can now find out what the result is which is the number of characters getline has managed to retrieve","width":519},{"text":"or a negative value if it failed","width":127},{"text":"so let's make a note of that","width":146},{"text":"and we'll print this out","width":125},{"text":"so i'll print it out as an integer and let's have a look to see what we can find inside our buffer","width":445},{"text":"so we want the result and we want the buffer","width":227},{"text":"and lastly let's put a newline here","width":169},{"text":"okay so we'll run our little program here","width":385},{"text":"and now it's waiting for me to type something","width":368},{"text":"okay great so it says i have got six characters","width":218},{"text":"wait and i printed ABCDE","width":102},{"text":"actually the last character might be a newline character","width":355},{"text":"and quite often we don't actually need that","width":152},{"text":"so why don't we overwrite the very last character with null with a terminating byte","width":439},{"text":"so let's write the code for that","width":160},{"text":"first of all we only want to do that if we get at least one character back from getline","width":289},{"text":"so let's check that the result was positive","width":300},{"text":"and also we only want to do this if we are going to overwrite the last character which truly is a newline","width":385},{"text":"we could imagine for example reading from a file where the very last byte is not actually a newline","width":363},{"text":"so we should just check to see what we're going to write here","width":233},{"text":"so let's look inside our buffer and where do we want to look?","width":275},{"text":"well if we read one character that would be at the beginning of the buffer","width":403},{"text":"so we need to look at result minus one","width":129},{"text":"so if that is equal to the character of a newline","width":352},{"text":"then let's truncate the string","width":262},{"text":"the easiest way to do that remember is strings are just terminated by zero","width":190},{"text":"so let's just put a zero directly into that byte","width":188},{"text":"so we are going to say at the same spot set that equal to zero","width":356},{"text":"right so let's run our program again","width":534},{"text":"okay so this time it read it correctly and in our printf we didn't get that unwanted extra newline","width":570},{"text":"alright our program right now is allocating memory on the heap","width":270},{"text":"we don't do it we let getline do it","width":127},{"text":"but it's actually up to us when we finish using getline to free that buffer","width":362},{"text":"right so let's do that","width":121},{"text":"let's at the very end here we can call free on the buffer","width":316},{"text":"we don't need to do that every time we call getline because getline by default will try to for performance try to reuse the buffer for each line it gets","width":576},{"text":"so for example we could call getline twice and it would try to use the same buffer","width":511},{"text":"but the big take home message for getline is first of all","width":186},{"text":"you are going to need a pointer to a buffer and a capacity variacle which getline itself is going to change the contents of","width":470},{"text":"as you call it it can make the buffer as large as","width":304},{"text":"each time you call getline it might change that buffer to point to some new memory if the buffer needs to be larger","width":439},{"text":"secondly it's a great idea to check the return value of getline to see how many characters it managed to read","width":469},{"text":"and also to see if there was an error or not","width":138},{"text":"and the return type for that is ssize_t for a signed size integer type","width":469},{"text":"and finally it's good practice to don't forget to free the memory that is pointed at by your buffer variable","width":546},{"text":"okay that's it for me","width":87},{"text":"have fun playing bye","width":78}],

  [{"text":"Hello welcome","width":135},{"text":"so this video is a little introduction to signals","width":222},{"text":"so signals are like a software interrupt","width":198},{"text":"we can use them to control our processes and even do things asynchronously","width":322},{"text":"so let's have a look at a little program i have written so far that doesn't use signals yet","width":333},{"text":"all it does is ask for the environment of home","width":181},{"text":"in other words the user's home directory","width":172},{"text":"and then we have a little loop that prints it out and sleeps for three seconds","width":314},{"text":"so every three seconds it is going to print out my home directory","width":211},{"text":"and on this machine i am root so it just keeps on printing out slash root","width":387},{"text":"so of course we can stop this program by pressing control c","width":383},{"text":"and when you do that you actually are sending a signal","width":195},{"text":"sigint or sig interrupt to the process","width":261},{"text":"now it maybe that our process doesn't like being interrupted","width":198},{"text":"why don't we catch that signal and install our own little handle for that","width":319},{"text":"so here is how we will do this","width":158},{"text":"i am going to say at the beginning of my program that if you get a certain signal say sigint ","width":797},{"text":"rather than having the default behavior which as we know is to stop the program or quit the program","width":367},{"text":"let us run my code instead","width":113},{"text":"so i will call it say nothankyou","width":227},{"text":"so what is nothankyou","width":113},{"text":"it has to be a pointer to a function","width":252},{"text":"how do we do that","width":61},{"text":"easy just write a function","width":75},{"text":"and in this case the correct type is something that doesn't return anything","width":310},{"text":"but does take an integer","width":136},{"text":"in fact it is the signal that is being sent to our program","width":253},{"text":"and so that we know that this is being called let's write something out directly to standard output","width":342},{"text":"so i can say write and i can say no","width":219},{"text":"so what is that that is a little message of three bytes to send","width":228},{"text":"so let's run this now","width":155},{"text":"okay so here is my program every three seconds it is going to print root","width":248},{"text":"but now i am going to press control c","width":359},{"text":"and it prints no no so it's refusing to quit","width":405},{"text":"you might also notice that the sleep also immediately returns","width":242},{"text":"more about that later","width":99},{"text":"it is still possible to stop our program here","width":180},{"text":"if we do control backslash then we force it to quit","width":382},{"text":"so sigint is one common signal that we send our programs","width":259},{"text":"there are many others","width":92},{"text":"just for fun let me show you one called sigalarm","width":239},{"text":"so this time i am going to say alarm seven seconds","width":498},{"text":"and so when you call alarm you are going to say give me a special signal called sigalrm in this many seconds","width":626},{"text":"in seven seconds","width":82},{"text":"and we better install then","width":112},{"text":"well let's just run it and see what happens to begin with","width":795},{"text":"so the default behavior of this sigalrm is to actually stop our program","width":299},{"text":"it quits the program","width":103},{"text":"that's a pretty aggressive alarm clock i think you'll agree","width":175},{"text":"and it also as you see prints out alarm clock on the shell","width":233},{"text":"perhaps we don't want our alarm signal to be so menacing","width":308},{"text":"so this time instead of sigint i can say look for a certain signal called sigalrm","width":452},{"text":"please call my function instead","width":515},{"text":"okay so there we go our alarm went off after four seconds and this time we asynchronously ran our code that printed out no to standard out","width":704},{"text":"so this is pretty exciting right","width":98},{"text":"you probably thought about interrupts on the hardware level","width":228},{"text":"now we can do interrupts at the software level and we can respond to things which happen in our environment very quickly","width":459},{"text":"so we will find signals to be very useful when we start dealing working with more than one process","width":381},{"text":"we can control our programs and we can also work with very large amounts of data coming in","width":371},{"text":"alright that is enough for me","width":106},{"text":"bye","width":36}],

  [{"text":"so usually we think about our programs as just turning into one single process","width":299},{"text":"now i am going to show you some systems programming magic","width":187},{"text":"where actually we can turn our single process into two","width":217},{"text":"here is how we are going to do it","width":105},{"text":"let us have a very simple program that says hello world","width":216},{"text":"and here it is","width":138},{"text":"so between these two lines however","width":198},{"text":"i am going to call fork","width":426},{"text":"and here's a surprise","width":91},{"text":"we get hello world world","width":90},{"text":"yes we get two worlds","width":129},{"text":"why is that","width":65},{"text":"well at the beginning there was a single process","width":117},{"text":"but then we called fork and now our single process is actually being cloned","width":340},{"text":"it has been split into two","width":111},{"text":"so both the processes print out world","width":164},{"text":"and so we see both their output on our little terminal here","width":297},{"text":"okay what else can we do with this","width":97},{"text":"well let us first of all show that there really are two different processes","width":192},{"text":"i am going to look at their processor id","width":351},{"text":"and we will print it out","width":168},{"text":"so i will call getpid()","width":102},{"text":"and you will see that yeah i have got two different processes","width":258},{"text":"both trying to run at the same time","width":191},{"text":"in fact i have got a parent child relationship here","width":289},{"text":"i have got the original process","width":128},{"text":"the parent","width":63},{"text":"and you can think of fork as saying let us clone this original process right here right now","width":375},{"text":"so that i get a child that looks just like me","width":153},{"text":"or at least almost like me","width":111},{"text":"in many many respects","width":63},{"text":"it is the same memory","width":152},{"text":"it has got it's own variables","width":63},{"text":"but because its got its own address space","width":251},{"text":"what the child now does in terms of its memory is seperate from the parents","width":369},{"text":"okay so let's show you what we can then do with this","width":330},{"text":"first of all fork actually returns something here","width":154},{"text":"it actually returns back an id","width":192},{"text":"so let's make a note of that","width":188},{"text":"and we'll print it out","width":124},{"text":"so we'll say %d and we'll print out just here","width":552},{"text":"okay so here is what we see","width":166},{"text":"that the process id 681 has fork value of 682","width":562},{"text":"and process 682 has a fork return value of 0","width":386},{"text":"so the fork value is different for the parent and the child","width":290},{"text":"and in fact fork","width":173},{"text":"if it returns a positive number is talking to the parent","width":238},{"text":"and is telling the parent here is the id number for your child","width":333},{"text":"so let us make a note of that","width":162},{"text":"let us call this","width":75},{"text":"here is my child","width":63},{"text":"so i can call my child","width":149},{"text":"and then i can write an if statement to decide if i am the parent or the newly created child or not","width":466},{"text":"so we will say look if the child id what i return from fork is actually greater than 0","width":470},{"text":"then i am the parent","width":194},{"text":"so let's put something like hey i'm the grouchy parent","width":575},{"text":"if it is zero however then hey I'm the carefree child!","width":905},{"text":"so we will let's remove this ","width":254},{"text":"i'll get rid of that line now","width":83},{"text":"okay so now we have a little program where the parent and child are going to do two different things","width":381},{"text":"and in fact it is standard for the parent to wait for the child to finish","width":438},{"text":"we don't have to but quite often we need the child process to do something for us","width":436},{"text":"perhaps in the background","width":112},{"text":"but we don't actually want to continue until the child has finished","width":234},{"text":"so let us do that","width":88},{"text":"what i am going to wait for my child to finish","width":262},{"text":"so i am going to say waitpid and i need to say okay what is the id i need to wait on well here is the childid","width":566},{"text":"and later on i can ask for some status information about my child","width":345},{"text":"and for now the last argument i am just going to put as 0","width":189},{"text":"so i need to have a variable called status just a little integer","width":299},{"text":"and in fact we are going to pass not just the value of status but the address of our little variable","width":400},{"text":"and later on we can use that to find out say did our child exit normally or was it terminated in a surprising way","width":492},{"text":"so let us run this now and what we will expect to see is that we'll wait for the child to finish before we print","width":519},{"text":"I'm the grouchy parent","width":63},{"text":"so let's run this","width":393},{"text":"okay so this time the child process got to print out I'm the carefree child","width":442},{"text":"then it exited","width":119},{"text":"meanwhile the parent was waiting for the async condition and when that happened","width":342},{"text":"the parent is able to continue and is able to print I'm the grouchy parent","width":416},{"text":"so i want to finish on a common programming error that can really bring down a server","width":564},{"text":"and that is suppose we made many many many processes","width":406},{"text":"so it is one thing to create a few","width":142},{"text":"let's call say fork a couple of times and perhaps you can guess how many worlds we'll see here","width":971},{"text":"that's right we see four worlds","width":146},{"text":"and in fact the parent finished early so this is the hash of the terminal saying what would you like to do now","width":540},{"text":"but we had four processes all printing out world","width":212},{"text":"and if we had three forks now we have eight","width":311},{"text":"okay so let us make something now called a fork bomb which is where we keep creating lots and lots of processes","width":550},{"text":"and this often happens by accident by people who are new to systems programming","width":326},{"text":"but just for fun because i am just doing this inside a browser it doesn't matter if i bring my little virtual machine to a halt","width":582},{"text":"i can always just reload the page","width":114},{"text":"so let's print out my id","width":630},{"text":"i will put this in a little loop that says while one let's fork","width":327},{"text":"let's print out my process id","width":347},{"text":"and then i will sleep two seconds","width":460},{"text":"so initially i have two processes","width":111},{"text":"and then each of those processes calls fork","width":209},{"text":"so we got four","width":51},{"text":"and then each of those processes call fork","width":171},{"text":"prints it out and sleeps","width":93},{"text":"and so every two seconds i am doubling the number of processes that are in my system","width":291},{"text":"so that's a lot of processes","width":124},{"text":"and in fact pretty soon the kernel will run out of space","width":324},{"text":"it won't be able to keep track of any more processes","width":138},{"text":"and fork will stop working","width":220},{"text":"and now we see here's the kernel printing out all sorts of debug messages","width":248},{"text":"desperately trying to make the system stable again","width":190},{"text":"as it arbitrarily starts to kill processes in an attempt to recover some memory and space in its process tables","width":539},{"text":"so amazingly my little kernel here has managed to recover to the point to where i have a working system","width":500},{"text":"but that is fork bombs and you should avoid from accidentally doing this","width":346},{"text":"otherwise you will have a system administrator telling you that you cannot log onto that machine anymore","width":286},{"text":"okay have fun and i'll see you in the next video","width":194},{"text":"bye","width":39}],

  [{"text":"okay, good morning class, how are you","width":367},{"text":"I'm good thank you","width":103},{"text":"alright, for those of you that weren't paying attention, cs241 has started. good morning class, how are you?!","width":373},{"text":"alright, great. so, in the next 15 minutes the game of course is for you to leave this room with more passion for system programming and maybe some more knowledge about how to do it as well","width":668},{"text":"and maybe some knowledge about how not to do it as well","width":210},{"text":"so one of the intents here is cover gotchas and common programming mistakes","width":280},{"text":"so, if you have a burning question, there's probably someone else in this room that has the same question","width":321},{"text":"I will endeavor to answer as many questions as possible without derailing the lecture","width":238},{"text":"so feel free to speak up","width":135},{"text":"if it's not appropriate, I will tell you","width":115},{"text":"and, just stay, come down and talk to me afterwards","width":147},{"text":"also, I hold office hours usually three times a week immediately after lecture","width":265},{"text":"because I figured thats the best way to reach most of the students","width":238},{"text":"so feel free to stop me","width":150},{"text":"I may not be able to stay for a full hour every time","width":157},{"text":"for example, there's a faculty meeting today where we're talking about how to take over the world","width":276},{"text":"uiuc style","width":83},{"text":"but most times I'm there to help you","width":286},{"text":"and I love to see people progress. its fantastic stuff when you start from the beginning of this course when you don't know anything","width":397},{"text":"till the end where you can actually do some pretty cool things","width":187},{"text":"and by the way, last semester many students came to me to say \"hey! you know what? I just had an interview and they asked me to explain X\" where X is a cs241 thing","width":657},{"text":"such as, what's the difference between a process and a thread?","width":223},{"text":"whats the difference between stack memory and heap memory?","width":136},{"text":"how would you do that?","width":55},{"text":"what's a common gotcha with this?","width":104},{"text":"why would a C program crash? that kinda stuff","width":265},{"text":"so you might find that the knowledge you gain in this class actually has an immediate impact for you outside of this class","width":413},{"text":"and if it does, wonderful!","width":160},{"text":"alright, so, let's get started with a couple of trick questions","width":333},{"text":"that we have here, wanna go to overhead, right!","width":292},{"text":"okay! how do you look up information for C library calls and system calls?","width":228},{"text":"easy! okay, here's the beautiful thing. with POSIX, POSIX includes many things","width":605},{"text":"it includes an API (application programming interface) in other ways, instead of calls, you can call","width":392},{"text":"and also, a manual of man pages about those calls","width":374},{"text":"so guess what? we're actually going to look up different calls","width":227},{"text":"the art of course is knowing which calls you should use","width":329},{"text":"and the POSIX man pages aren't going to tell you that","width":202},{"text":"you already have to have a basic idea of \"oh yeah! I need to use open\" or \"or yes! I need to use write or stat or lstat or fork()\"","width":629},{"text":"so that's the main thing you're going to get out of this course is the vocabulary","width":264},{"text":"with the then end expectation that you would actually then start to use this stuff and look it up","width":320},{"text":"so we've got two different kinds of things. we've got C library calls and system calls","width":463},{"text":"the C library is the part of your process","width":188},{"text":"okay, what's the difference between a program and a process?","width":153},{"text":"well, the program is the code that you've written turned into bytes which say you stored on disk","width":339},{"text":"and then when you actually execute it, or actually run it, it becomes a process","width":274},{"text":"and of course you can have multiple processes running for the same piece of program code","width":310},{"text":"but part of that process is the C library","width":146},{"text":"it comes kind of bundled with or loaded at runtime and it's a set of code and maybe some constants too that just runs as part of it","width":524},{"text":"so what kind of C library calls do we have? well for example, perhaps you want to do a string copy where you want to say \"okay, copy all the bytes into a destination from a source\"","width":787},{"text":"and we're gonna pass two pointers and it will keep copying those bytes starting from source into destination until what?","width":666},{"text":"until it reaches a zero byte","width":156},{"text":"because that's the definition of a C string","width":192},{"text":"of course, bad things might happen if you accidentally put these in the wrong order","width":312},{"text":"alright, if you tried to copy from some arbitrary place into a different place, who knows how many bytes its gonna copy before it gets to zero? oops.","width":512},{"text":"who knows where its going to immediately crash your program?","width":171},{"text":"for example, it might be that you try to write into some read only memory","width":306},{"text":"and the hardware say \"ah ah excuse me? excuse me? you see that process over there? it's being a baaad baaaaad process\"","width":483},{"text":"ok lady gaga I might","width":107},{"text":"so, look I enjoyed that joke personally","width":296},{"text":"so, let's um, this is an example of a C library call. it doesn't need to go into the system to run this","width":635},{"text":"we can do this entirely inside the process space","width":218},{"text":"inside the virtual memory of our proces","width":226},{"text":"ok, what about system calls? well, here's an example of one, you've already seen it: \"write()\"","width":412},{"text":"we want to get outside of our system. we want to break out of our system and get the system to break outside of our process and do something","width":444},{"text":"to the rest of the world","width":123},{"text":"okay, so, the system itself needs to handle that particular call","width":361},{"text":"and in fact it does that using a hardware interrupt","width":262},{"text":"that's the red pill, if you follow the matrix movie","width":218},{"text":"that's how you escape out of the box. out of the sandbox that your poor little process is stuck inside","width":508},{"text":"anyway, so we want to look up say some information about these and so for that we can use \"man\"","width":420},{"text":"which reads man pages","width":154},{"text":"which are incredibly terse and utterly useless if you dont have some basic knowledge","width":322},{"text":"but pretty useful if you already know something about what you intend to do","width":369},{"text":"so let's try one","width":276},{"text":"box pc","width":392},{"text":"okay so let's try looking up for example \"printf()\"","width":317},{"text":"there it is","width":44},{"text":"and it's in section 3 of the man page","width":96},{"text":"okay yeah, we want to open it. there it is","width":125},{"text":"now what do we see about these man pages? well the things I want to show you is that first of all it tells you what includes you better have","width":448},{"text":"it also includes a whole load of function calls which do similar things","width":300},{"text":"so, as well as printf, we've got sprintf or snprintf","width":367},{"text":"and, then we've got some really terse information on what it's gonna do","width":286},{"text":"and usually its got a return value as well","width":299},{"text":"so they might return say the number of characters printed","width":316},{"text":"excluding the NULL byte used to end output strings","width":192},{"text":"notice how those display little parenthesis here as if its not that important","width":325},{"text":"as if the number of bytes written is not that important to you","width":189},{"text":"as if that could never cause a big program to fail","width":239},{"text":"accidentally, you might assume that that is the actual number of bytes written","width":218},{"text":"no no no, it excludes it and it's an off by one error","width":172},{"text":"it's actually going to ignore the fact that it may have written a zero at the end because it's the end of a C string","width":394},{"text":"oops! that's exciting.","width":107},{"text":"you may have not had enough memory. you may have overwritten something else","width":306},{"text":"so, when you read man pages, read them slowly and try to understand everything they say","width":443},{"text":"and of course, it's always useful to find an example","width":266},{"text":"oh, this one actually has one, look at that! amazing","width":194},{"text":"most of them don't bother with an example","width":101},{"text":"so you end up doing any google search to say \"okay, easy example of blah blah blah blah\"","width":339},{"text":"but yeah so they're a good reference material","width":220},{"text":"now you'll notice we had different sections","width":137}],

  [{"text":"Let's do another one","width":182},{"text":"Let's look for fork - create a child process. Yes, that's right, you create children by forking","width":922},{"text":"I knew you'd remember something from this lecture. We'll play more with this later because it's an amazing thing you can do with posix. You're first process can actually clone itself, at that very moment to become two separate processes","width":1221},{"text":"It's like you pull a switch and suddenly you've got a doppelganger","width":347},{"text":"If you're a physicist and you think about the many worlds theorem, it's a bit like that. The world from a process point of view splits into two. Suddenly you've got two processes for the price of one","width":681},{"text":"OK, so we'll see that. But again, notice we had different sections","width":265},{"text":"The sections you're going to see are.... can you see this? let's see if we can make it bigger","width":721},{"text":"section two, alright. This is where all the system calls live","width":368},{"text":"section three, this is where you'll find the C library stuff","width":275},{"text":"and section seven, you'll occasionally find there's actually longer articles. I hesitate to call them tutorials, they're not that useful","width":668},{"text":"but more long winded articles that have some better practices. it's worth reading at some point during this course","width":472},{"text":"you might find some useful information there. for example, when we talk about signals, but most of the time you'll be using these as reference","width":496},{"text":"unfortunately, let's go back to here and look up stat. some words appear in multiple places and if I make a new window here","width":970},{"text":"and I do man stat, then I get the wrong one. I get the one that would happen from the shell. So i have to say 'no, no, no I really wanted section two'","width":942},{"text":"so sometimes you have to force it to find the right section","width":411},{"text":"that's enough about man pages. you will be using them. when it comes to quizzes, i'll talk more about that later, but i will have expected you to know something basic about the return values, some of the common gotchas of using different calls","width":1074},{"text":"do you remember how to allocate memory on the heap?","width":398},{"text":"if your neighbor said 'malloc' congratulations, you made a good seating choice","width":356},{"text":"yes, malloc is one way to say 'hey, I need some memory and it's mine until I what?'","width":855},{"text":"free it, yes! ","width":216},{"text":"when you call malloc you are going to point to some bytes. will those bytes be zero?","width":788},{"text":"do you feel lucky punk? the answer is maybe, but it's not guaranteed. ","width":411},{"text":"if you get a brand new, fresh page of memory from the OS it's likely to have been zeroed out by the OS to make sure you don't accidently get any information from another process","width":831},{"text":"remember, we're trying to keep our processes separate, so you can't accidentally read someone else's password, or secret key, or something else that's secretly happening inside another process","width":550},{"text":"the OS makes sure to usually give you some zeroed memory","width":315},{"text":"however, if it's reuse of your own memory, it's quite likely there's just garbage in there","width":493},{"text":"it could be that because it's zero it lulls you into a false sense of security, you assume memory is zero","width":607},{"text":"why did C do this? sounds like a terrible thing to put the onus on programmers to make sure their programs always work. why didn't they always zero out the memory?","width":941},{"text":"time consuming, yes! C is all about trying to be as efficient as possible and if you can't cope with that, get a different major","width":725},{"text":"That is C's attitude, maybe we can find tools to spot memory errors, but it's very much a case of we're trying to write a language which is just a little bit above assembler. it's meant to be that it's almost as efficient as assembly code, just a lot easier to read and write","width":1409},{"text":"malloc has to be very efficient because we use it a lot. think about your java programs, OK I'm sorry. I know that was a bad experience, but think about all the times you've made new objects, etc.","width":832},{"text":"underneath that we're saying 'OK, I need some more memory'","width":276},{"text":"so malloc's job is to find some bytes. you say 'oh quick, I need another thirty two bytes and I need it right now. I can't continue my process untiil you give me thirty two bytes fo rme to play with. And, yes, I promise to free it later when I'm finished with it.'","width":960},{"text":"some processes are allocating a lot of memory all the time. so malloc tries to be efficient and when you free some memory, we can put it back into this pool of bytes that we can use later again. That's why it's called a heap, it's just going to be a big disorganized mess of allocated space and unallocated space","width":1346},{"text":"And, in fact, it's tricky to write malloc and free, so we are going to ask you to do it in 241","width":491},{"text":"we've got malloc and free. later on you'll also see halloc and realloc, but let's not talk about those now","width":580},{"text":"you can just implement those on top of malloc","width":389},{"text":"suppose we wanted to write our own string copy function. here it is!","width":562},{"text":"because these are character pointers, I should mention, how big is a character in C? ","width":638},{"text":"the size of a single [byte]","width":221},{"text":"if I do sizeof character,the answer is one. everywhere, at all times, before I even compile the code. it's a definition that the size of a character type is one","width":1079},{"text":"sizeof gives you the number of bytes","width":416},{"text":"so a character is always one byte. If i put a variable name in there I'd get one","width":618},{"text":"when I add one to these pointers, it is going to be incrementing along one byte at a time. I read one byte and I add one to the source pointer and add one to the destination pointer","width":902},{"text":"this code is slightly broken. perhaps you and your neighbor can figure out how it should be fixed. i'll point out the following","width":742},{"text":"what does this do? while star source","width":363},{"text":"thank you, yes! remember star means dereference, follow the money, take this expression and use it as a memory pointer and actually tell me what's in there","width":649},{"text":"because we're talking about a character pointer, we are asking memory to read just one byte. if we had an int pointer we might be reading four or eight bytes","width":553},{"text":"but, no, we're reading one byte. while this is non-zero, do something. with C, anything which is a non-zero value is true","width":679},{"text":"what a wonderful simple world","width":185}],

  [{"text":"my love for you is 42","width":170},{"text":"so this means this is going to continue until we get that null byte","width":386},{"text":"alright that's enough hints","width":107},{"text":"let's fixed that code","width":185},{"text":"right so see if you and your neighbor can fix this code faster than your other neighbor that you're not talking to","width":724},{"text":"it's not copying the string, that's one of the bugs","width":3769},{"text":"copy the bytes so actually we didn't just want to copy src into dest ","width":331},{"text":"all this would do is whatever the value of src is whatever the value of src is i is just some memory location, we set that into dest","width":456},{"text":"but dest is just a local variable so that would actually do nothing, it would actually just change src into dest","width":419},{"text":"what we want to do is just use src as a pointer","width":226},{"text":"so we need to put a star in here","width":168},{"text":"there we go","width":38},{"text":"right so we should have read the value at src hey go back to memory and then use dest as a pointer","width":424},{"text":"we wanted to dereference it ","width":75},{"text":"we wanted to say okay now write that value into whatever dest is pointing to","width":269},{"text":"so we've done that, we've copied one byte and we increment both pointers","width":251},{"text":"and then we go back around the loop so we're going to keep writing bytes until we get to the null byte","width":335},{"text":"is my function finished?","width":141},{"text":"no, what's wrong with it?","width":284},{"text":"yes thank you, yes we forgot to copy the null byte","width":289},{"text":"so this function is broken it forgot to copy the null byte","width":266},{"text":"but it might work if you test it if you happen to test it with memory that was already zero","width":417},{"text":"and you think aha I finished my mp","width":162},{"text":"right, no your code is broken","width":178},{"text":"because is forgot to terminate the C string","width":172},{"text":"and then some future function would start reading this and it wouldn't come across a null byte because there would be garbage after it","width":453},{"text":"and it would start printing random characters","width":274},{"text":"until it eventually got to a null byte","width":183},{"text":"of course if it didn't get to a null byte maybe other bad things would happen","width":192},{"text":"anyways so let's fix this","width":123},{"text":"we needed one more line to say after the while loop ","width":157},{"text":"alright the src should be a null byte which I could write like this","width":926},{"text":"okay here's another example of a classic C error which is when you've got two pointers you're probably using the wrong one","width":629},{"text":"okay so make sure that we change the very last byte at the end to be a zero byte","width":372},{"text":"so we terminate it","width":113},{"text":"we could have also fixed this by using a do while loop instead of a while loop","width":506},{"text":"so we would have only done the check at the very end","width":137},{"text":"we would have copied at least one byte","width":128},{"text":"alright so that was my string copy","width":156},{"text":"how about something that actually duplicates strings","width":424},{"text":"right so we want something that takes a character to some memory and we are going to make a new memory object","width":642},{"text":"and we're going to copy the contents of the original into our new piece of memory","width":347},{"text":"right so how do I get some new memory? easy I remember what I said ten minutes ago and say malloc","width":610},{"text":"so I've got malloc I've got the right size I copy.. whoops wait a moment I've got two pointers am I using them in the wrong direction?","width":673},{"text":"if in doubt, yes I probably am right?","width":159},{"text":"how do we check?

maybe it's being used for another variable in which case we've just overwritten the value of another variable","width":636},{"text":"and that is how many C programs are vulnerable to buffer overflow","width":407},{"text":"that is how you could hack into say, a web application which didn't put enough space on a buffer","width":735},{"text":"and you could then overwrite nearby variables","width":290}],

AH. we want to compile it in debug mode","width":537},{"text":"okay there we go, right","width":79},{"text":"so this time we, haha, yes! this time we remembered to include the assert.h and assert is actually a macro. it expands to include that underscore underscore line thing","width":837},{"text":"and underscore underscore file","width":86},{"text":"so now, here we go, when we run this, it prints out program.c at line 15 inside my function main assertion 3<7*0","width":578},{"text":"it's pretty useful. it actually shows you the expression","width":163},{"text":"it's a nice simple development thing to use asserts","width":329},{"text":"because then you can check that people that are calling your functions are actually giving you say valid arguments","width":317},{"text":"and you can check that your assumptions are correct before you try to write complicated code","width":344},{"text":"and, it kills your program. it aborts","width":203},{"text":"so that's assert","width":302},{"text":"now then, pretty easy to use, remember to include it, include...assert.h and then, and then inside your program you just say assert and write an expression you expect to be true","width":1181},{"text":"like \"Hey! its wednesday!\"","width":184},{"text":"if that expression is true, nothing happens","width":206},{"text":"and in fact, when you make a release build, this expression isn't even tested","width":464},{"text":"this compiles to no code","width":176},{"text":"so it's good for performance","width":230},{"text":"but then you realize that you've been living on the edge. it doesn't actually check it.","width":384},{"text":"and it's a macro, because we want to be able to print out the actual contents of the expression we're going to test.","width":405},{"text":"and also we want to print out the line number. and also it's a macro because we can make the contents of the macro disappear when we do a release build","width":718},{"text":"so, with that, let's see if you can write a version of string cat. and what you want to do for strcat is append the contents of another string onto the end of the first string.","width":1066},{"text":"but, we're not sure that people are giving us valid arguments","width":281},{"text":"so how would you write this so that it aborts if either one of these were NULL ?","width":385},{"text":"what would you write?","width":65},{"text":"so see if you and your neighbor can finish this","width":303}],

  [{"text":"good morning cs241 people. how are you this morning?","width":1248},{"text":"great, how's everybody else?","width":225},{"text":"alright, let's try this again. okay, alright, yes, good morning! you've enrolled in cs241, for better or for worse, you'll learn a little bit about systems programming","width":470},{"text":"and for the next 50 minutes, we are going to talk about some new stuff, some old stuff, some [something] stuff, some blue stuff","width":286},{"text":"I lied about the blue stuff","width":94},{"text":"alright so, all I have to do is open my mouth and talk and type. all you have to do is open your brain and think","width":403},{"text":"how hard can it be?","width":66},{"text":"let's try again: good morning people, how are you?","width":178},{"text":"great!! good morning class.","width":64},{"text":"alright, so, the reason I do that is because maybe we'll get a few brain cells working before we actually dive into this stuff, okay?","width":448},{"text":"so, here's the exciting news. yes there are exams in this course. there's no single midterm. instead, there are multiple choice exams scattered throughout the course","width":674},{"text":"and the first one will be on Friday","width":321},{"text":"yes, so, please come on friday, bring your icard, bring a pencil, and look forwards to multiple choice questions which go over the things we've covered so far","width":601},{"text":"anything we've done in lectures or you've done in previous sections, it's fair game.","width":424},{"text":"okay, so I'm looking to make sure basically that you understand the basics of C programming","width":314},{"text":"so as a result, some of the questions we've got today are to do with [something] in C.","width":313},{"text":"alright so, where's my handout?","width":281},{"text":"okay, let's have a look at this first question then, right","width":461},{"text":"I've written a C process, or any kind of process really, that runs for a long time and it's creating other processes","width":555},{"text":"so for example, it might call fork() and then the child process that you've just created calls exec","width":479},{"text":"but we never wait for our children to finish","width":296},{"text":"but they do. but we never call wait on them","width":161},{"text":"what have we created?","width":160},{"text":"zombies! yes! we've created dead processes, processes that have finished but no one's cleared up after them","width":492},{"text":"now, if you see any zombie movies, you'll discover there's different ways to kill them. right.","width":314},{"text":"but, running away is usually what's recommended in most zombie movies","width":275},{"text":"but fortunately, what we do in C programming is just call wait, and when we do that, the system can kind of clear up the mess left by the zombie","width":617},{"text":"if we don't do that, then eventually, we're unable to create new processes. the system runs out of space","width":539},{"text":"alright so yes, we've created a zombie in this case","width":342},{"text":"so a zombie's a dead process where all we're returning essentially is it's exit status. but it's still taking up a little bit a system resources because we haven't finished cleaning up after itself","width":768},{"text":"and it only happens if no one ever calls wait","width":193},{"text":"so for that, I need a long running process","width":335},{"text":"so let's see what happens in the other case where my child outlives the parent. would you like a handout?","width":461},{"text":"we have a question","width":479},{"text":"that happens when the parent dies. okay?","width":199},{"text":"so that's why the question up there says \"long running parent\". the parent hasn't died. it just doesn't care about its children","width":422},{"text":"the children have finished, alright, perhaps they've called \"exec\" and done an \"ls\", perhaps they finished doing a computation, perhaps they finished serving a webpage to a client.","width":511},{"text":"the point is, the child processes, once they finish, they're still taking up space","width":466},{"text":"alright so, let's not have a look at a zombie. let's have a look at the other case that you just brought up","width":359},{"text":"which is what happens when the parent finishes first?","width":382},{"text":"ok, so, I've got a little bit of code here, and uh, first of all you could ask, what's it actually print? the answer being nothing! because actually if you look at it, you'll see this #if #endif","width":740},{"text":"those are preprocessor directives to tell the preprocessor to say \"well if this expression is true, then include this, otherwise don't\"","width":586},{"text":"and, so of course right now, there is no main method. compiler would never actually see the code we wrote in here","width":379},{"text":"right, I could write garbage in here. like, alright, you know I could write \"superbowl\"","width":492},{"text":"um, and it's not gonna find an error in there because the actual compiler doesn't check for the syntax. it keeps going until there we go","width":520},{"text":"alright um, so let's fix that, let's just say #if 1","width":295},{"text":"okay, right, and we'll run this and a question for you is, before I run it, how many times is it going to print \"I am process\"","width":759},{"text":"cuz you see it happens before fork()","width":102},{"text":"and secondly, who's sleeping? is it the child that's sleeping or is it the parent that's sleeping?","width":674},{"text":"if you made up your mind, tell your neighbor. see if they agree with you","width":483},{"text":"if you're not sure, at least have a guess","width":2192},{"text":"okay! alright! so, who's sleeping? is it the child or the parent?","width":429},{"text":"the child! remember, fork() returns twice, if you like. because, when we call fork, after it executes, we've now got two processes. we've got the original process, and the clone","width":767},{"text":"the doppleganger","width":64},{"text":"that believes it really is the same original process because it can look back in its mind and say \"yes, I was born in kansas\"","width":335},{"text":"right? it remembers all the variable states but its actually got a copy of everything (well, nearly everything)","width":461},{"text":"but there's one asymmetric difference which is that, if you're the child, your return value of fork() is zero","width":436},{"text":"so we are asking the child to sleep()","width":272},{"text":"okay, meanwhile then, both processes carry on independently, you can imagine them running on two different CPUs","width":482},{"text":"they're completely different processes. just like you can be running Minecraft and working on your chemistry homework at the same time","width":513},{"text":"and we print something out. we print out our pid and our parent's id. so let's run this...see what happens","width":576}],
  // Part 1
  [{"text":"alright, so, the first surpise is that we see 'I am process' twice","width":956},{"text":"that's weird, why did that happen? let's talk about in a moment","width":177},{"text":"and then second thing is one of the processes said:","width":248},{"text":"and my parent is 1","width":289},{"text":"okay, how, why? well remember we made the child sleep. we made it sleep for an extra second. in that second it's original parent finished","width":686},{"text":"it exited. so now what are we going to do with the child now? who's parent should it be?","width":231},{"text":"and now's where the system says 'I know what! we will reparent you back to the ultimate process' parent process id one","width":643},{"text":"so that's what happened there. if we didn't have this sleep then we have a race condition. maybe the parent finished first, maybe the child would've finished first","width":495},{"text":"we cannot say for sure who would finish first so that's why we put the sleep in","width":286},{"text":"okay, but why is it that we saw 'I am process' twice?","width":321},{"text":"OK, if you think you have the answer wave your hand in the air like you just don't care. you care","width":415},{"text":"alright, very good yes. okay! so, a few people know. i'll give you a hint","width":528},{"text":"I'm going to change the program very slightly by putting '\\n' in there","width":802},{"text":"and now you only get 'I am process' once. so by putting ","width":439},{"text":"'\\n' in there I changed the output of the program quite significantly. what does '\\n' do?","width":784},{"text":"yeah! thanks. in our little example here, C decides to flush the buffers. so there's abuffer inside the process and it's just collecting bytes. just collecting the characters to print out","width":920},{"text":"but it didn't bother to actually write them out to the system yet. it only decided to do that when we saw the new lines. so in this example we ended up callling write(), we printed it out, before we called fork()","width":931},{"text":"in the first example it was still inside the process so when we forked it was still there inside the child as well. the child says 'oh yeah,I've still got these bytes to print out. I haven't got round to it yet'","width":798},{"text":"so be wary about this. the other thing to note is that at the very end of the program part of the clean up that the C library does is says 'hey ok any open file descriptors if you have something to write out do it now because this process is closing. it's time to flush all the buffers' so it does that as part of the standard clean up process","width":1464},{"text":"right, so that's a little example there. how much buffering actually happens depends partly on wheter your trying to send it to a terminal or a file","width":1059},{"text":"if you're sending stuff to a file it will actually keep buffering beyond the '\\n' so it tries to have even better performance by buffering stuff out to a larger amount before writing them","width":952},{"text":"questions about this example?","width":207},{"text":"yes?","width":288},{"text":"right, so if we choosed fprintf() ","width":382},{"text":"aha, OK, right, so puts() is equivalent to printf() %s \\n. OK so that would've actually flushed it as well","width":1170},{"text":"and so if I used fprintf() the same thing would've happened if I sent it to standard out because the buffer of standard out by default when I'm sending it to the terminal is to wait until I say new line","width":714},{"text":"if I send it to standard error, well lets just do it. we would have seen it once because the default for standard error is just to push things out. we don't want to wait, we're not trying to get high perforance. you want to know your error messages as soon as possible just in case the process dies very quickly","width":1427},{"text":"alright, so, if we wanted... remember how I said we've got somewhat of a race condition? I've just put in a sleep for a second and that kind of works on this particular system","width":727},{"text":"if we wanted to actually wait for our child ","width":550},{"text":"then I can call waitpid(). so how's waitpid()? let's check the old man page. waitpid","width":1273},{"text":"so, you see we pass in the pid we got from fork. we can get some status information and there's some flags as well that we don't need today","width":872},{"text":"so what we'll change now in our output? ok, what's our little error here? ","width":649},{"text":"oh I didn't declare a little variable. there we go","width":832},{"text":"OK so this time the parent of the child is still the, huh. OK.","width":1420},{"text":"why would that be? so the parent is waiting for the - oh. okay, yeah we called waitpid() on two, we should only be doing that inside the parent, so let's do that for the parent. so if I'm the parent then ","width":1435},{"text":"we'll wait for our child to sleep","width":399},{"text":"OK yeah now thats sorted, that makes sense. right, so, what've we got there? the orignal one is 198 and it's parent is 43 which is probably this little shell program here that's running and the child is 199 and it's child is 198 so we should have two numbers right which are the same","width":1367},{"text":"this is the child saying 'oh look here's my parent 198 and this is our original program 198 saying my parent is 43'","width":624},{"text":"so, you can actually discover all the processes running on your system. this one doesn't have that many and I don't know if you've got pstree involved","width":728},{"text":"you can use ps and pstree to kinda get a hierarchal view of all the processes that a process has. there's different options to say OK, I want to know about my process or everybodys processes but don't worry that's not on the test, okie dokie...","width":1056}],
  // Part 2
  [{"text":"so, now it's time to talk about signals","width":240},{"text":"unless anybodys got any last minute burning questions","width":263},{"text":"ok, right, signals are called. there's a lot to signals we're just going to do an introductory part today","width":446},{"text":"but signals are the software equivalent of hardware interrupts","width":379},{"text":"so, think about hardware for a moment ","width":208},{"text":"i can have things like a clock timer that goes off every say hundred milliseconds ","width":414},{"text":"and interrupts what the CPU is currently doing","width":173},{"text":"and when the CPU sees that it says 'oh I'd better stop doing what I'm currently executing' and run some additional code thats gonna cope with the fact that my little clock timer has gone off","width":692},{"text":"or I've got some bytes from the disk which are ready to read and I want to stop what I'm doing and execute some different code","width":434},{"text":"or some information on the USB bus has arrived like someone plugged in a USB keyboard or typed something and I need to handle those bytes","width":564},{"text":"right, so interrupts allow us to stop doing what we're currently doing and process some different code","width":384},{"text":"we could do the same thing with hardware and that's signals","width":183},{"text":"and, we can send signals to our children and we can get a signal back evern when one of our children dies, which is useful","width":663},{"text":"and we can have a lot of fun with them because they can do differnt things","width":488},{"text":"so, first of all, that's a list of all the processes","width":436},{"text":"let me send a signal to one of these processes","width":299},{"text":"so, uhh, ok, do I have a pid variable here? no I don't. okay so, let me just send -9","width":559},{"text":"to say process 43. what've I just done?","width":548},{"text":"yeah, I've killed myself","width":145},{"text":"ok, the kill command says 'send a singal' and -9 is the ultimate of signals - hint hint - terminate this thing with [something] it can't stop this signal","width":992},{"text":"if you send this signal to a process that process is gone","width":422},{"text":"there's no way to protect against this signal","width":296},{"text":"this is the big weight falling on top of a signal. this is how you can kill processes","width":232},{"text":"so if you know - if you are a superuser and you know a processes id, you can get rid of it","width":645},{"text":"OK, so fortunately I have another processes here. let's see if this one works","width":493},{"text":"unfortunately I can't actually write any code so it's time to reboot my machine","width":896},{"text":"okay, so! we can do something similar in our programs as well","width":391},{"text":"let's pull up some example code here","width":2347},{"text":"alright, we won't do that straight away, ok, so here's some typical fork exec() code","width":375},{"text":"the child decides to run /bin/ls and the parent will do something else","width":758},{"text":"so, let's first of all just start off with this. there's nothing new in this code, I just want to prove to you that the child runs exec() here and should print something out","width":773},{"text":"here we go, so yeah we'll move on it. the child runs","width":205},{"text":"okay now, what we'll do this time is I'm going to make the child sleep for one second because now I'm going to call kill() from my program here. I think you can guess what's going to happen here","width":701},{"text":"alright so, we'll check kill() on section 2 and you'll see that we can send a signal to a process","width":734},{"text":"alright so, we have the id that we wanted to call, there it is, it's called child, and what should we send it? well let's send it signal 9","width":1114},{"text":"oh, we had a sleep there. so this time you'll see the poor child never got to run /bin/ls, we klled it and it didnt' stand a chance","width":637},{"text":"we could also send a signal called SIGINT, in fact, rather than send it to the child, why don't we send it to ourselves","width":893},{"text":"let's do it straight away","width":249},{"text":"I wonder what SIGINT stands for","width":478},{"text":"ok, so the SIG is a standard thing you'll see prepended toward the singal of different names","width":446},{"text":"INT stands for interrupt","width":188},{"text":"remember how you can press ctrl+c and the program stopped? this is how it works","width":441},{"text":"the shell says 'oh look, look, someones trying to press ctrl+c, I will send SIGINT to the running process'","width":488},{"text":"and that's how we break our processes","width":594},{"text":"well, this is where the fun begins. I don't have to see my processes die when you press ctrl+c","width":572},{"text":"we can do other things for the SIGINT and for that we're going to look at SIGACTION","width":649},{"text":"SIGACTION allows us to register a callback function that's going to be run when the signal is given to this process","width":690},{"text":"ok, so, here's how sigaction() works. I didn't want to use sigaction(), I was going to use the simpler version","width":1042},{"text":"yeah, let's use signal() ","width":994},{"text":"we'll talk about sigaction() later on in the course","width":297},{"text":"ok, this is what I wanted to show you. so our typedef here. is that large enough for people? can I make it larger?","width":685},{"text":"can you read that at the back?","width":256}],
  // Part 3
  [{"text":"okay alright so, we've got a typedef that say \"typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int)\"","width":404},{"text":"and then this sighandler underscore t. let's talk about this for a moment. as to how to parse this","width":868},{"text":"alright, so we know that typedef just really means \"hey! I'm an alias\" I'm just defining a new type and in this case, this is a function pointer","width":752},{"text":"so, we can [something] this by unpacking it from the inside out. so, we can have a function that takes an integer","width":586},{"text":"and returns nothing","width":271},{"text":"and, our type goes in the middle (between the parenthesis)","width":196},{"text":"so have a pointer to a function. in other words, just, where do we want to send the CPU to actually execute some code? here's our little function that's gonna happen","width":584},{"text":"and then I can install this handler for a particular signal","width":260},{"text":"so should a certain signal happen, run this handler","width":246},{"text":"alright, so, let's do that","width":513},{"text":"I'm gonna have a signal handle then. and I can call it noway. I can call it anything I want, really.","width":559},{"text":"remember it takes a void. call it agentsmith alright, you'll see why in a moment. and remember it takes an int","width":858},{"text":"so, at this point, we'll write something out. like, \"you can't stop me!\"","width":549},{"text":"okay, how many letters is that? who knows? about 13","width":363},{"text":"and, we want this to run anytime someone tries to stop this program","width":214},{"text":"so, let's use that signal() thing","width":153},{"text":"so we'll say signal when I get a SIGINT, run agentsmith","width":675},{"text":"and, then i'll have a little loop that does a. keeps itself busy. while(1) loop forever","width":460},{"text":"so, while true, keep going","width":117},{"text":"alright so, let's run this little program here","width":851},{"text":"okay, off it goes, and let's try and press Ctrl-C","width":479},{"text":"oh no! alright, you can't stop agent smith here. anytime you press Ctrl-C, that signal is delivered and fortunately, you can press Ctrl-\\ and that should","width":876},{"text":"okay, there we go, alright. I can at least Ctrl-Z it so I can actually stop the program. so something else to show gives me the ability to pause the program.","width":506},{"text":"and if I wish, I could actually put that into the background. does it support it? okay, yeah, it does and now its in the background","width":617},{"text":"and now it's just running and using up my CPU","width":181},{"text":"if I do \"ps\", there it is. it's running. it's used up 32 seconds, now its used up 34 seconds of CPU, I'd better kill it.","width":502},{"text":"okay, kill minus 9 106","width":235},{"text":"it's gone! remember, SIGINT you cannot stop. so you could try to. sorry, SIGKILL or SIGTERM you cannot stop SIGTERM","width":784},{"text":"alright let's go back","width":195},{"text":"right, so let's first see what it's going to do with child processes. here's the whole thing. let's change our message to say \"child finished\"","width":631},{"text":"and this time, we will make our message a string here so char mesg","width":736},{"text":"I can get a signal when one of my children dies","width":325},{"text":"so strlen(mesg)","width":270},{"text":"okay, right, so, write out the number of bytes that's in that message","width":536},{"text":"so now, rather than doing SIGINT, guess what, there's something called SIGCHILD","width":364},{"text":"and let's make this a little larger","width":354},{"text":"and this time rather than looping forever, we'll do our fork() and now when the child is finished running ls, why did it, oh, aha!","width":1672},{"text":"that's not gonna be very useful, okay.","width":329},{"text":"we'll get rid of the sleep() there as well","width":341},{"text":"so, this time, the child runs ls hopefully, oh, no.","width":367},{"text":"SIG, oh, I can't spell","width":195},{"text":"yes, for some reason, CHLD is spelled without the I","width":272},{"text":"I guess bytes were expensive in those days? okay, alright so, hooray! here's what we've got","width":769},{"text":"the child ran and then the parent was notified asynchronously that the child finished","width":506},{"text":"so if you wanted to do some stuff in the background and you're worried about zombies, this is the perfect place to put that waitpid","width":475},{"text":"to say \"hey! I need to clean up my children\"","width":156},{"text":"so that's in fact a very common convention with these kinds of programs","width":334},{"text":"is, if you don't want to just fork() and then wait() immediately, just write yourself one of these signal handlers and then we can put our waitpid in here","width":595},{"text":"so, we'll need to know the child id, we have a status variable, and a zero here, okay","width":724},{"text":"the last thing I need to do here is that child itself [something] out of scope here. so instead, let me declare as a global variable","width":723},{"text":"now, global variables in large programs considered [something] programming practices. however, you will often see them in small, single-file system programming examples","width":943},{"text":"because it's an easy way to communicate with signal handlers","width":401},{"text":"alright so now, okay, well, you can imagine if I was actually able to type, you can see that we're being good citizens and we're cleaning up our children using a signal handler","width":896}],
  // Part 4

I'll walk around in case anyone's got any questions","width":18098},{"text":"ok, so, that assert() call at the beginning. the nice thing about assert() in production code it disappears, there's no performance overhead. it's not even evalutated","width":693},{"text":"the macro compiles to nothing, so the purpose of this is during debugging I want to catch early if someone gives me a bad pointer","width":585},{"text":"right, so if we say character result, then anytime we use the variable result in the future it will point to the beginning of the array ","width":432},{"text":"sounds great, we can use up to 256 bytes, in other words a string with 256 pics, 255 letters and a 0 byte at the end which fits","width":490},{"text":"however, this is an automatic variable stored on the stack, which means it's scope is only for the length of this function","width":627},{"text":"and, if we try to store anything in here, that's ok, but it becomes meaningless after the function returns","width":537},{"text":"so, yes, we can return a pointer to this array, but don't expect that memory to be valid after the function returns","width":444},{"text":"so, that's no good. we need memory that's going to exist for longer than that","width":307},{"text":"so we turn to malloc() to say 'hey give me some memory on the heap please'","width":239}],

  [{"text":"Okay, good morning class, how are you?  Fantastic, right!  So here's what we're going to start doing now, we're going to start talking about memory.","width":1536},{"text":"You could imagine if we went back into the early, early hours of computing, we had it easy, right?  Well, there's proper instructions here, and we'll use location 100 to mean this and 112 to mean that, and we won't have to worry about dynamic memory allocation; we'll just make all those decisions upfront as we actually design the program.","width":1728},{"text":"Then later, we say, \"Well actually, we want to have functions.\"  And later, we want to have functions that can call themselves and be able to recurse.  So, for that we need a stack.","width":768},{"text":"And for that, then, as we make function calls, our stack pointer needs to move.  And inside the stack we'll store our temporary variables and also our point where the CPU should go back to when it returns from the function.","width":896},{"text":"So our stack... we'll start a lot higher up in memory and as we make more recursive calls our stack will get larger and larger and larger and larger, of course - until we run out of memory.  And then we said, \"Well actually, we don't want to decide what memory we'll need upfront either, we want to be able to have dynamic memory allocation, and we don't know when we're going to free up that memory.  We don't know when we've finished with it.  We want to make that completely dynamic and it's part of our program.","width":2176},{"text":"And thus, the idea of the heap was born.","width":192},{"text":"The idea that at any point, we can say, \"Oh!  I need more memory!  And give it to me now and this is how much I want and I'm not going to tell you when I'll be finished with it.\"","width":704},{"text":"So it's very different from the stack memory.  Stack memory: you know you'll be finished with that memory when you return from the function.","width":512},{"text":"So with stack memory, you've got automatic variables.  They automatically disappear - no more work...","width":448},{"text":"With the heap, of course, now we actually have to say, \"Okay, give me the memory\" and \"I'm finished with it.\"","width":320},{"text":"So you've used the heap of course in Java and in C++ when you said 'new' and 'delete' in C++.  Typically, they go on the heap memory.","width":704},{"text":"I say 'typically' because C++ can do some amazing optimizations when you're not looking the compiler will quickly say, \"Hey!  You didn't need to write that!\"","width":576},{"text":"\"Here!  I'll optimize your code, so that actually there's no code written at all.\"","width":256},{"text":"When you write new/delete you explicitly create, well, we'll just simplify it and say \"Yes!\"  We're making things on the heap.  So we need some memory, so let's call malloc().","width":704},{"text":"So malloc() is part of the C-library.  It's part of your process.  It decides where your memory's going to be.","width":640},{"text":"If you like, it says, \"Oh look!  Table of four.  Right, I need  four seats.  You can sit over here.  This table over here is free.  You sit over here.  Oh, you've finished with that table?  Oh, great!  Get out of there because I'm going to reuse this table for something else.\"","width":832},{"text":"Alright, so malloc() has to very quickly decide where it can assign you some memory.","width":448},{"text":"It gets harder because we don't know in which order our memory is going to be allocated, and in which order memory is going to be freed.","width":960},{"text":"And even if you knew that order, it's an NP hard problem to do it well.","width":576},{"text":"Called the Knapsack Problem.","width":256},{"text":"So even if you knew exactly which order the malloc()s and free()s were going to come in, how would you do it efficiently is a non-trivial problem.","width":576},{"text":"That sounds computationally expensive, right?  If we made our malloc() perfect, it's going to take a long time.  \"Yeah, I could put this table of two here, but you know what there's a big order coming in in a moment and so I don't actually want to put them there I want to put them over there.\"  There's an infinite number of possible ways that we could arrange things in memory.","width":1280},{"text":"So malloc() has to be efficient but fast.","width":320},{"text":"So this is the basic game we have to play.","width":320},{"text":"*picture problems*","width":1280},{"text":"Don't write this down, this is just a visual.

Good.","width":256},{"text":"So my little blocks here indicate 1 kilobyte blocks.","width":320},{"text":"And during the execution of my program it says, \"Well, I'm gonna make a linked list or I'm gonna make an image, and I need some memory.\"  So part of your code says, \"I need say 2 KB.\"","width":1152},{"text":"So malloc() now has to look through the memory and say, \"I tell you what, I'll give you these two blocks here.\"","width":384},{"text":"If anyone else calls malloc() I promise not to return any pointers that point to this memory in here.","width":576},{"text":"So malloc() is going to return the address of the first few bytes and internally it has to do some book-keeping.  It has to make a note that these first 2 KB are being used.","width":640},{"text":"And then your program decides to malloc() some more memory.  So it says, \"Okay, I'll have 2KB now please.\"  What should malloc() do now?","width":832},{"text":"Well, it can't use this area of memory.  It has a choice: it could put it here and here.  It's not going to allocate here and here, though.","width":1280},{"text":"Why does it not say, \"I'll give you some memory there and there\"?","width":576},{"text":"We've fragmented the memory, but also when malloc() returns a pointer, your assumption is that all the bytes you've been given are contiguous.  You might want to use it as just a simple array, for example.","width":1152},{"text":"So we've got a problem here.  We have to allocate memory that is in the same area so let's say we put these little x's in here.  And then of course someone says, \"malloc(2 KB)\".  What happens now?","width":1408},{"text":"We can't!  We don't have enough spare memory.","width":320}],
  // Part 1
  [{"text":"Now if this was a very small... two things could happen: our program could just crash - malloc() could just give a bad answer.  But we want to be a bit more systematic than that.  So at this point we'll go back to the operating system and say, \"Hey!  You know that memory stuff that's really valuable?  Give me some more, I need some more.\"  So actually malloc() at that point has to go back to the operating system and say, \"Hey, you know that memory you gave me?  I've run out.\"","width":1984},{"text":"I need some more.  I need more memory.  So malloc() can get some more memory from the operating system.","width":704},{"text":"How does it do that?  Well, classically it would call something like sbrk().","width":640},{"text":"What is sbrk()?  You can write this bit down if you want to.  Let's jump into the rabbit hole for a moment and think about our process where we've got all these memory addresses to play with.  ","width":1280},{"text":"So what do we find inside memory?  We've got our code, we've got our global variables or the static variables... up here we've got the environment and the stack...where's our heap live?","width":2368},{"text":"Just here.  It starts off just here.","width":448},{"text":"So it can grow, right?  We can say, \"Excuse me, system.  I actually need some more space.\"  And that's what sbrk() does.","width":768},{"text":"It says, \"Look, you've got this watermark (this threshold) of what the maximum address is.  I want to bump it up, I want to play with some more room.\"","width":768},{"text":"So this means we could write a really, really simple memory allocator.  Here it is.","width":1152},{"text":"Any time the program asks for more memory (x bytes) all we will do is say to the system, \"Hey!  I need more bytes.  This is the number I need.\"","width":832},{"text":"And anytime the program decides it's finished with some bytes, what should we do?","width":832},{"text":"Nothing!","width":320},{"text":"That's the simplest memory allocator we could write.","width":320},{"text":"It's not a very good one, though.  We're not re-using any memory.","width":448},{"text":"Because we're not keeping track of which pieces of memory are actually being allocated.  We're just simply saying, \"Oh look!  I've got some more passengers on my boat, I need a bigger boat.\"  Or, \"I've got more people on my bus, I need a bigger bus.\"","width":832},{"text":"And not keeping track of how many seats are actually unoccupied.","width":320},{"text":"So it's really, really fast but completely inefficient.  We're very quickly going to exhaust all of our memory.","width":512},{"text":"And so this sets the stage now for our memory allocator.  We actually need to start keeping track of which bytes are currently being used and which bytes are available for suitable calls to malloc().","width":768},{"text":"So we only want to call this sbrk() thing when we truly are out of memory.  When we have no way to allocate any more memory.  ","width":832},{"text":"So the MP (which will be out maybe the end of the week or maybe next week) is actually going to ask you to write an efficient malloc().  And it fact it's going to be a competition.","width":1280},{"text":"So there'll be a page with results and you can see if your malloc() is faster than your neighbor's malloc().","width":704},{"text":"So remember when they step away from the keyboard to put a sleep() call into their code.","width":320},{"text":"Okay, so what's to stop you from doing this all the time?  Easy: the competition is actually going to put a hard limit on the amount of memory that you are allowed to play with.","width":896},{"text":"So now we have to start coping with the fact that memory's being freed.","width":512},{"text":"So if we are working with writing a good malloc(), let me show you a little problem that we might run into.","width":1984},{"text":"Here's some memory that's been allocated.  Here's some other memory that's been allocated at different times.  And then our program says, \"You know what?  I'd like 2 KB.\"","width":832},{"text":"Now you can see from my little diagram that I've actually got 3 KB of memory which are unused.","width":640},{"text":"But I cannot give you 2 KB.  I cannot find any space which is 2 KB because my spare space has all been fragmented.  It's no longer in a contiguous block.","width":1216},{"text":"So why can't I just take all the contents of this memory and just move it into there, and then carry on?","width":704},{"text":"Why can't I just move that?","width":256},{"text":"Why can't my malloc() just start shuffling stuff around?","width":384},{"text":"I can copy stuff!  My malloc() can copy it to there.  However, the rest of my process is using pointers.  It assumes that the stuff that's inside here is where it is so it assumes that if I've got a variable that's pointing to a linked list that it's using this area.  ","width":1536},{"text":"So all those pointers will be invalid.","width":256}],
  // Part 2
  [{"text":"So malloc() by itself cannot do that.","width":320},{"text":"Java does a little trick here, by the way.  What Java does is its pointers are actually pointers to pointers.","width":1088},{"text":"So remember when you had a pointer to something, like an object pointer?  And next time someone says, \"But there are no pointers in Java!\"  And then you say to them, \"Well why does Java have a 'null pointer exception?\"","width":1088},{"text":"So how does this work internally?","width":384},{"text":"This pointer points to a pointer which points to the actual memory that Java's using.","width":704},{"text":"Why does Java do that?  So that it can shuffle things around.  So that it can deal with this fragmentation problem.","width":640},{"text":"So here's what we're trying to solve here is fragmentation.","width":512},{"text":"And the reason I mentioned this thing about Java is because when you are using the JNI, on the Android NDK, you are going to discover that you have to pin and release things.","width":1344},{"text":"As part of your C code.  And what you're doing is you're saying (to this intermediate pointer), \"Oh no no no, I've got a bunch of C code right now that is using this data, so you can't start moving these things around.  You can't shuffle this block of memory around right now because my C code is using it.\"","width":1600},{"text":"So Java uses a counting mechanism to note that C code is currently using these pointers and can't shuffle the memory contents.","width":832},{"text":"You'll discover this stuff when you start working on the Android NDK challenge.","width":384},{"text":"So our game then is to try to avoid this fragmentation.","width":576},{"text":"This fragmentation's bad, right?  Now we have memory that we can't use for large allocations.","width":384},{"text":"Our game is also to do this efficiently.","width":256},{"text":"Here's where we're gonna look at three little problems.","width":512},{"text":"So this is actually an exam question.  It's one of the easier exam questions.  And what we're gonna do is forget for a moment this whole stuff about sbrk() and going back to the system to get more memory.","width":1344},{"text":"We'll just say that we've got a heap initially of 13 KB.","width":320},{"text":"And we've got an order of calls.","width":640},{"text":"So as new calls come in, we can decide where to put them.  And here's three different placement strategies.","width":1088},{"text":"Best fit, worst fit, and first fit.","width":256},{"text":"And we'll see as we do this that they lead to different assignments, that our malloc() will decide to place these requests in different parts of memory and so we'll have different fragmentation so that if our program continued, we might discover that future large allocations are impossible.","width":1600},{"text":"So what do we need to know about this?","width":320},{"text":"First of all, if you've got a choice, you choose the earliest segment.","width":576},{"text":"So what that might mean is let's say with best fit, let's say I've got space here of 2 (which happens to be a perfect fit; in other words, I'm trying to find space for 2 K, then I would just choose the one with a smaller memory address.","width":1536},{"text":"Worst fit.  Oh, how contrary can you be?  The idea here is that if I've got a space which gives me the maximum amount of space after I've done the allocation, I'll use that.","width":1728},{"text":"Okay, so let's have a look at worst fit, where I've got a 2K space here and a 10K space there and I'm trying to allocate 2 KB.","width":832},{"text":"Worst fit would not put it in this spot here, it would break apart this 10 KB space and say, \"I'll tell you what: here's how we'll change.  I'll allocate my 2 KB there, giving me a remaining space of 8.\"","width":896},{"text":"What do you think first fit does?","width":512},{"text":"Pretty obvious, right, from it's name.  We're simply going to walk along our free spaces until we find the one which is sufficiently large, and use that.","width":832},{"text":"So if I'm looking for 2K, oh look!  There it is, I'll use that one.  If I'm looking for 3K, oh, it's not gonna work for me, I'll have to keep searching.","width":896},{"text":"So they're very obvious placement strategies (from their names).  Now, it's up to you to actually run them.","width":896},{"text":"So here's the actual order of calls to malloc() and free().  Where do the allocations end up?","width":320}],
  // Part 3
  [{"text":"There was a question about best fit.  Best fit will scan through, looking at all the possible holes.  Obviously we can ignore all the holes (or spaces) which are too small.","width":1024},{"text":"And it will use the space which is at least as large as the request, but hopefully no larger.  And if it so happens that there's two spaces that satisfy that search, then we use the one lowest in memory.","width":1344},{"text":"So, question?","width":128},{"text":"Anytime you've got a space, you do the allocation at the beginning of the space.","width":1472},{"text":"*nothing happens here*","width":4224},{"text":"*again nothing, class discussion, Angrave filling out sheet*","width":7296},{"text":"Okay, so.  Let's have a look at this.  So first fit: I've gotten as far as filling out A, B, and C and now I've called free() on B, and now I need to allocate another 3 KB.  Where could we put it?","width":896},{"text":"Well, we've got space here and we've got space at the end.  And we're trying to do best fit.  So best fit is going to put it in here because it's a perfect fit.  If I put it starting at 3K, I would've had a space of one left over, so that's not quite as good.","width":1088},{"text":"And then we free A, and we allocate one KB.  Where could we put this?  Well, there's only one place.  There's one big giant space over here.","width":960},{"text":"So we'll put E there.","width":320},{"text":"What happens in worst fit?","width":320},{"text":"Nothing changes at the beginning here.  C, C, C.  Okay, so.  Now we free() B.","width":1088},{"text":"And we allocate 3 KB.","width":192},{"text":"So: where's our choice?","width":256},{"text":"We could stick it here, or we could stick it at the end.  Which one is worst fit gonna use?","width":256},{"text":"B, ye!","width":192},{"text":"Because we have the largest space if we allocate it there.","width":256},{"text":"So let's put our D in here.","width":192},{"text":"And now we free() A.","width":448},{"text":"And we want to allocate one byte.  So what are our choices?  We've got a space of 3, space of 1, and space of 3.  Where's worst fit gonna put our final allocation?","width":768},{"text":"Yeah, it's a tie-up between the first few blocks here and the last few, so we'll put it just here.","width":320},{"text":"Okay, and first fit","width":192},{"text":"Okay, let's do this quick. ","width":320},{"text":"We'll do the D.  3KB.  First fit is the Scrappy-Doo of fits.  As soon as we find enough space, we'll stop.  And we've just cleared out our space of four so yes, we can put D in here.","width":1664},{"text":"And now we'd free A, and finally we allocate 1 KB.  So we run along our spaces - oh, look!  Here's our free one.  And we'll stick E in here.","width":704},{"text":"I'm sorry, yes, you're right.  We'll stick it just there.","width":576},{"text":"Okay, so this was a pretty trivial exercise.  But what I wanted to show you is the mechanics of these programs, and that they also lead to spaces in different places.  Also, there's a little thing that we did quite easily but you'll have to remember to do in code, which is: look at this, we had A and B, and at some point we freed up two allocations next to each other.  And so we had to go from thinking that this is a space of two and a space of four into think that this is just one big space of 6.  And if we didn't do that, then if somebody asked for a malloc() of 6, then your algorithm would say, \"I'm sorry, I don't have space to allocate 6B because counting will keep this as a space of 2 and a space of 4.\"","width":3840},{"text":"We could coalesce those two free areas together into a single block, and so that is a common gotcha when implementing malloc().","width":576},{"text":"That you have to look at the space beforehand and the space afterwards to see if you can coalesce them.","width":448}],
  // Part 4
  [{"text":"Right, um..","width":128},{"text":"No need to need to remember that until you actually write your own allocator","width":256},{"text":"Okay, so let's just think about some of the comparisons of these then","width":320},{"text":"So what we'll do first here: what's one of the advantages of first fit?","width":256},{"text":"It's fast! As soon as it finds some space, hey we're done! We don't need to do any more","width":576},{"text":"Okay, what's one of the advantages, say of best fit? Or any disadvantages?","width":640},{"text":"Okay, so, think it's least amount of fragmentation","width":576},{"text":"Because it's ideal!","width":960},{"text":"Okay, so that is uh, do we know that for sure?","width":256},{"text":"It appears to be from this example, right?","width":320},{"text":"But is it true? In all possible uses?","width":320},{"text":"What about disadvantages?","width":512},{"text":"It's slower than first fit","width":512},{"text":"Because we have to check all spaces","width":384},{"text":"Okay, let's do worst fit and I'll come back to this one","width":512},{"text":"Right, what about worst fit?","width":128},{"text":"Yes, it's slower than first fit again because now we have to go through","width":640},{"text":"Any advantages to it?","width":384},{"text":"Any other disadvantages to it?","width":128},{"text":"Let's think about what we're doing for a moment.","width":320},{"text":"So worst fit is always going to find the largest space and use that","width":384},{"text":"So that means in a longer-running program, if you've got a giant space, it's going to quickly be eaten up","width":320},{"text":"So with worst fit, what you find is that you end up with lots of kind of medium-sized spaces","width":448},{"text":"Yeah, we can always go back to the system and say, \"Hey, system, I need some more memory\"","width":704},{"text":"But what we're trying to do is see what our fragmentation looks like given the space we've got","width":320},{"text":"So, because we keep attacking the largest space, means that we don't have one large area should a giant allocation request come in","width":768},{"text":"Alright, now we've got these medium-sized holes, these medium-sized spaces, scattered all over our memory space","width":576},{"text":"So we cannot satisfy very large requests","width":320},{"text":"But we keep attacking that large block, right?","width":640},{"text":"I'm trying to think of a good analogy, but uhh","width":384},{"text":"You always can say, \"Oh look, I've got this really really big block at the end, I'll keep using that\"","width":256},{"text":"Now what we haven't talked about is think about the fact that our memory gets freed up as well, okay?","width":384},{"text":"So, this large block keeps getting attacked, and we end up with smaller, medium-sized blocks scattered through our memory if we run this process for long enough","width":640},{"text":"We're always attacking the largest space, we're always kind of nibbling bits off it","width":576},{"text":"So best fit seems to be, \"Hey, we're not going to get much fragmentation, we're always trying to find the perfect jigsaw puzzle\"","width":576},{"text":"The problem with, yeah?","width":192},{"text":"Yeah, yeah there are some interesting caching issues, yes","width":1856},{"text":"Okay, okay, okay, so the question's about, \"hold on, we've got virtual space, with virtual memory you can actually do some interesting mapping to real memory\"","width":1344},{"text":"Yes, that is true","width":192},{"text":"However, that mapping happens at four kilobyte chunks","width":192},{"text":"Um, so, we can't completely get away from our fragmentation issue","width":384},{"text":"So, yes, underneath this for the real memory, we can avoid some fragmentation","width":576},{"text":"Given that malloc actually has some space, you know it's got a low address and a high address, our question is how can we efficiently use this memory?","width":512},{"text":"Right, so, I want to address this least fragmentation thing","width":256},{"text":"It appears to be ideal. It can be, if you set up your simulation correctly, but when you, uh, run it under more realistic conditions, what tends to happen is you end up with lots and lots of tiny, tiny, tiny little holes. Or tiny pieces of spaces.","width":1024},{"text":"So you could imagine that you've got, say, a request comes in four 15 kilobytes and you happen to have a 16 kilobyte space free, so you'll use that","width":768},{"text":"Now you end up with this tiny 1 kilobyte unused space","width":320},{"text":"So, in practice, best fit tends to give you these tiny, tiny spaces which are difficult to reuse","width":640},{"text":"So, quite often, some variant of first fit actually turns out to be a pretty good choice","width":512},{"text":"What first fit tends to do is the size of the holes tends to vary as you walk further down your list of free spaces","width":576},{"text":"So, this is actually often a pretty good choice","width":192},{"text":"Okay, so that was placement strategies","width":448},{"text":"Let's talk about a few other things with memory","width":448},{"text":"So we talked about where it's stored in memory","width":320},{"text":"It's stored just above the code and the global variables","width":192},{"text":"And we can call sbrk to say, \"oh we need some more space\"","width":256},{"text":"So what then are the challenges of actually writing a good malloc?","width":384},{"text":"How are we going to keep track of which parts of our memory have been allocated and which parts are free?","width":512},{"text":"What would you use?","width":128},{"text":"If I said to you right now, \"Okay, start writing a malloc\", how would you keep track of","width":576},{"text":"Say again?","width":192},{"text":"An array of what?","width":128},{"text":"Okay","width":448},{"text":"A disjoint set of regions in memory, okay","width":576},{"text":"Okay, so here's what I'm going to ask you to start with is just a simple linked list","width":256},{"text":"We can start with just a linked list of what's been allocated","width":320},{"text":"And what's been freed","width":192}],
  // Part 5
  [{"text":"So if we go back to our picture that we were drawing","width":448},{"text":"To say 'Oh, look, this has been allocated, this has been freed, this has been allocated, this has been freed.'","width":704},{"text":"What we need is a way to say, 'Okay these are just entries inside a linked list.'","width":768},{"text":"And I can walk along these looking for blocks which are, say, large enough.  And then when I find a block (let's say I'm going to use this one), I need to update my data structure so that I've now got an entry to say 'Hey, this part has now been allocated, and'","width":1600},{"text":"'I've got some remaining space.'","width":128},{"text":"And we go back.  So we can choose to take a block out and turn it into some space and some remaining free space.'","width":1088},{"text":"Which of course if that's zero, you don't need to have this entry.","width":64},{"text":"When you call free someone's going to give you a pointer to one of these used areas.  ","width":1408},{"text":"And we have to go through our linked list then to update our counting - to say, 'Okay let's turn this now into some free area.'","width":640},{"text":"Remember how I gave a little advert about coalescing blocks?  Well, our work may not be done because you can imagine that, over here, I've got a free block, and on this side I've got a free block.","width":1344},{"text":"So I now need to update my counting on my linked list to say 'You know what this is now just one giant block if I've got it on both sides, a huge block of free space that can be reused.'","width":1024},{"text":"We could do this really, really inefficiently by having a linked list and then when someone says, 'Oooooh!  Free a pointer.'","width":1088},{"text":"I'll just walk through my linked list until I find my entry that corresponds to that pointer.  Oh my gosh, that'd be really slow.  Okay, I'll tell you what, I'll use a hash to speed it up.  I'll have a quick hash so that I can find my pointer and go back to my pointing structure and update my linked list structure correctly.'","width":1472},{"text":"When actually we can do a lot better than that.","width":320},{"text":"We can store our linked list structure as part of the memory that we allocate.","width":576},{"text":"Here's a clever trick.","width":384},{"text":"Let's allocate some memory and we'll allocate a little bit too much.","width":448},{"text":"So if the user says, 'Hey, malloc() 100 bytes we're going to malloc() say 120.'","width":576},{"text":"And we won't tell them, okay?  As far as the caller is concerned, they're just getting 100 bytes.'","width":576},{"text":"But the reason we did this is because we're going to store some secret information back here that's actually our linked list information (our pointer to where to go next).","width":640},{"text":"Wheeeee!","width":320},{"text":"When we return, don't return the pointer to the beginning of here.  No, make sure you bump up the return value so that the return value from your malloc() actually says, 'Okay, user program: here's a little space, here's the 100 bytes that you wanted.'  So we'll add our twenty bytes or however large you made it.","width":1728},{"text":"And when the user later says, 'Okay!  I'm done with my pointer.'  When they call free(), we have to play the other trick and go the other way and say, 'Okay now where did that block REALLY start?'  Let's subtract our 20 bytes again.","width":1152},{"text":"And if we do that, we can find our pointer.  Our linked list structure.","width":320},{"text":"So we're hiding the link information inside the allocation.  Pretty sneaky, huh?","width":576},{"text":"It gets even sneakier than this.","width":320},{"text":"We're going to do two more little things to make it really, really sneaky.","width":384},{"text":"First of all, we'll discover that we actually need to be able to go the other way.  If we start with a block over here, I actually want to be able to kind of have a doubly linked list.  I want to be able to go back to the previous block.","width":896},{"text":"So not only do I want to store the pointer to the next, I want to store the pointer to the previous.  So I'm going to put that over here.","width":576},{"text":"And I'm also going to actually store this information at the end as well..","width":576},{"text":"So if I come over here, I can always look at the previous block and say, 'Okay, where are you?  Where's your start?'","width":512},{"text":"The other thing that we can make use of is rather than storing actual addresses (pointers), we can just store numbers.  We can store the number of bytes and then use pointer arithmetic.  If you know that this is 120 bytes long, and we're looking at the beginning here, then we can just add 120.  We can just store 120 as the size of this thing.","width":1536},{"text":"And we can jump to the next entry.","width":320},{"text":"Or if we look back here to the previous value, then actually we're looking back at the previous block.

We can actually put some values into our heap barrier.","width":576},{"text":"And then we just check that those values are still correct.","width":64},{"text":"like there special hexidecimal values, like deadbeef, deadcode, or a value that is a quick hash of the values we want to store.","width":640},{"text":"So we can at least verify that things haven't been overwritten.","width":192},{"text":"So debug versions of malloc and free will do this. They'll take some extra space to write begging and endpoints.","width":512},{"text":"And then before they do anything, they'll check those values to see if they've been overwritten.","width":384},{"text":"So we can't stop the override, but we can at least detect it afterwards.","width":512},{"text":"Any questions?","width":512},{"text":"By the way this idea of putting the size inside as part of the allocated area, this was developed by, I think, Donald Knuth, many years ago.","width":832},{"text":"We've been living inside the user process. Now let's step back a moment and talk about virtual memory.","width":704},{"text":"What do we mean by virtual memory? We've virtualized memory. Ok, what do we mean by that?","width":256},{"text":"We mean that the addresses that our processes uses can have very little connection with the actual addresses that the RAM sees.","width":704},{"text":"That, in essence, there's a mapping.","width":192},{"text":"So ya, we can keep talking about the process address spcae.","width":256},{"text":"It goes from zero up to some high number, let's say 7fffffff.","width":256},{"text":"And we can think of it in terms of little blocks.","width":128},{"text":"And in fact, our virtual memory likes to work with pages called, and there typically about 4096 bytes, or 4","width":704},{"text":"So, anytime you read or write into your virtual memory, we've got to take that address.","width":512},{"text":"Some magic happens.","width":256},{"text":"And say ok, which piece of RAM, which physical address, should I read or write to?","width":896},{"text":"This side will have virtual memory, and and this side we have real addresses.","width":448},{"text":"And it's the MMU, the Memory Management Unit, that has to convert one to the other.","width":768},{"text":"Now today we're just doing the quick two minute version, because there's a lot more to say about this","width":384},{"text":"I just want to give you an idea we can actually step outside the matrix.","width":192},{"text":"Once we start playing these tricks, there's some amazing things we can do with this, as system programmers.","width":512},{"text":"This is a fundamental piece of any reasonable hardware that runs a modern operating system will have a memory management unit,","width":832},{"text":"in order to convert virtual memories into physical addresses.","width":320},{"text":"And here's the cool thing is that now these don't need to be contiguous.","width":192},{"text":"That this mapping can be all over the place.","width":256},{"text":"So this 4K can go to some lower memory and this 4K can go to some other piece of RAM.","width":384},{"text":"So this allows us to use our physical memory much more efficiently.","width":320},{"text":"We don't have to worry about fragmentation, now, and having holes or having spaces inside our physical memory that we can't use.","width":576},{"text":"[So if it's stored on the hard drive...] Ah yes, I wasn't going to mention that but ya.","width":384},{"text":"Here's the cool thing is that now we can now say to every process, \"Hey! you want 4GB? No problem!\"","width":192},{"text":"\"You want 4GB? No problem! You want 16GB? No problem!\" Ok my machine only has 1GB but don't tell them.","width":384},{"text":"Because what we can do is, ya, we can actually secretly store some of the information they want on the hard drive.","width":640},{"text":"It's basically like this, imagine only the bits of the world your currently looking at exist.","width":320},{"text":"Any time you turn around and look behind you, I'm going to put you on pause and quickly recreate everything that you intended to look at.","width":640},{"text":"When I finish doing that, I'll release you again.","width":192},{"text":"So that's what the virtual memory, that's what the operating system does for you.","width":320},{"text":"You think you got 4GB of space. I just promised you that.","width":320},{"text":"Promises are easy because I know you can't actually look at it all at the same time.","width":320},{"text":"I'm going to intercept any time you try to read or write memory to make sure that what you're trying to read or write actually appears to be there inside RAM.","width":512},{"text":"But it's all conjuring. It's all fake. And it's up to the operating system to do this for your process and any other process that's currently running.","width":576},{"text":"Right, that's enough of virtual memory today.","width":512},{"text":"But it's a wonderful system. It's one of the best parts of an operating system today, I believe.","width":320},{"text":"Instead, let's talk about something which is just as powerful and is going to separate your programs from mere novice programmers.","width":896},{"text":"And that is being able to use threads effectively.","width":192},{"text":"This is the beginnings of the major part of this course here, is to understand how to work with synchronization and work with multiple threads. ","width":576},{"text":"This is the coolest bit so here we go.","width":192},{"text":"Let's put on some basic ideas here.","width":192},{"text":"How many heaps does a process have?","width":384},{"text":"That was easy. One.","width":128},{"text":"Inside your process memory a heap is used for all those malloc and free calls and there's only one heap. ","width":640},{"text":"So it's just a BIG area of space that anytime you want memory from you can just call malloc, or calloc or realloc.","width":448},{"text":"But you can just say \"Hey I need some memory and this is how many bytes I need.","width":192},{"text":"It's stored in the heap.","width":256},{"text":"How many stacks?","width":64},{"text":"When we first introduced our program modal we had just one","width":384},{"text":"We said, \"What's a stack?\"  Well, anytime you call a function I need some space for those automatic temporary variables","width":320},{"text":"And also a bit of space to say where the CPU should go back to when it finishes calculating anything we need to do inside that function.","width":512},{"text":"And if the function is recursive then my stack is going to get lower, bigger and bigger, because I'm going to keep calling myself and I need more space on the stack.","width":512},{"text":"And if my function calls other functions, ya agian, my stack is going to get bigger.","width":256},{"text":"That's a stack.","width":320},{"text":"What if I had two CPUs working inside my process at the same time?","width":512},{"text":"Each one needs a stack. Yes?","width":192},{"text":"Because each one will be inside a function; that function might be calling things.","width":448}],
  // Part 5
  [{"text":"So here is the basic idea","width":256},{"text":"I going to have one per thread","width":320},{"text":"So our processes have at least one thread of execution","width":640},{"text":"And it would start in main, as far as we are concerned","width":256},{"text":"And finish when you either called exit or returned from main","width":64},{"text":"And now I'm going to show you how we can have multiple threads going inside each process","width":576},{"text":"So let's start on the stack. All the automatic variables, also known as temporary variables,","width":448},{"text":"(the reason they are called automatic is because they automatically disappear when we return from a function and our stack gets shorter)","width":640},{"text":"You'll find the return address for the CPU, in other words what code you want it to execute when it finished calculating the current function","width":832},{"text":"and the last thing we'll see is the previous stack pointer, or the previous SP","width":832},{"text":"Because we want our stack to shrink when we return from the current function","width":768},{"text":"So what happens if our stack gets too large?","width":320},{"text":"It's.... Stack Overflow. Yes! You've probably heard of Stack Overflow.","width":448},{"text":"I actually registered as the username Infinite Recursion, I couldn't believe it wasn't already taken","width":448},{"text":"So we have a limited amount of memory so in a single threaded model, our stack would meet the heap. Kaboom, and we're out of space","width":1024},{"text":"Our program crashes. In fact, by the power of Virtual Memory, what we can do is set up little pages of memory that are like quicksand","width":768},{"text":"If our program attempts to read them, then it will crash the program deliberately, we send it a Segmentation Fault. Yes? ","width":512},{"text":"[Student asking question]","width":192},{"text":"Can you sbrk more memory for the [stack]. No, no you cannot. Sbrk represents the top of the heap.","width":512},{"text":"[Another student question]","width":128},{"text":"No, but where they meet depends how big your heap is and how big your stack is","width":384},{"text":"What we're going to do is make multiple threads though, supposing we have multiple CPU's working at the same time","width":448},{"text":"So what we'll have to do is make our stack start in different places","width":256},{"text":"So there is actually a possibility of one stack hitting another stack if it gets too large","width":384},{"text":"Now let's have a look at some code, let's play with some code","width":448},{"text":"Here we go. C'mon. Great.","width":448},{"text":"We are going to be working with a thread framework called pthreads","width":256},{"text":"It's very popular, you can run it on Android machines as well","width":320},{"text":"Here's the plan: We are going to make our program do some CPU cycles","width":512},{"text":"We agree that our program will never print Hello World, it will just go around this loop forever","width":320},{"text":"But what I would like to do is have a second CPU working on my machine","width":384},{"text":"And for that, I can call pthread_create","width":256},{"text":"There's four arguments, let's have a look at them","width":192},{"text":"First, we have a pointer to pthread_t, some attributes which can just be NULL, this scary looking thing and finally an arg","width":896},{"text":"Let's talk about each of these","width":320},{"text":"First of all, this is a function pointer. It looks pretty scary, void star start routine ahhhhh!","width":448},{"text":"Here's how to read this: You see where it says start routine?","width":256},{"text":"Just interrupt that as the name of your function and then work backwards. It's going to return a pointer to a void* and it takes a void* as an arguement","width":704},{"text":"And then we wrap the name of the function with an extra set of parenthesis. Let's take this and write our function","width":768},{"text":"Cool beans","width":576},{"text":"Alright, what should we do inside cool beans?","width":320},{"text":"Let's sleep for 2 seconds, then we will print out the pointer","width":896},{"text":"And a new line. Ok, so now let's call pthread_create","width":384},{"text":"We can have a pthread id. So we pass in the address of that stack variable, we aren't doing attributes today","width":768},{"text":"Now we can just pass in the function name. If you ever pass in a function name without the parenthesis, it means \"Tell me the address of this code\"","width":576},{"text":"And finally we can pass in a void *, so we write (void *) 12345","width":960},{"text":"Let's write something in hex.

","width":384},{"text":"Here's what we're going to talk about today. We're going to talk about using threads.","width":384},{"text":"Threads are cool because we can now make our single process do multiple things.","width":384},{"text":"And threads are cool because they allow multiple threads to share the same memory and the rest of the state of your process.","width":576},{"text":"So if you've opened a file descriptor in one thread, you can use it inside another thread.","width":384},{"text":"The exciting thing happens, though, when you have to wait for one thread to complete something.","width":256},{"text":"And for that, we need to worry about synchronization.","width":320},{"text":"And that's what sets your programming apart from things you've seen inside CS 225 and 125, earlier courses and other people that might have just picked up some programming.","width":640},{"text":"The ability to work with multiple threads correctly so that it always works when not just ten users are on your website, but a thousand users are on your website","width":512},{"text":"or you've got multiple CPUs inside your tablet, or your phone, or your watch, then that's where synchronization comes in.","width":512},{"text":"But anyway, let's get started. Little question, little memory question for you.","width":320},{"text":"My thread calls pthread twice, pthread_create twice, how many stacks does my process have?","width":896},{"text":"Ok, let's pick someone at random. Hi! What's your answer?","width":384},{"text":"If you said one, guess again.","width":384},{"text":"Any advances on one?","width":256},{"text":"If you said two, thanks for playing, but almost correct, off by one.","width":320},{"text":"It's three! Why?","width":320},{"text":"Thank you, yes! We get a thread for free at the beginning.","width":448},{"text":"One thread must be calling main, our CPU must be executing code at main","width":320},{"text":"All we did by calling pthread_create twice is we got ourselves two additional threads.","width":384},{"text":"And remember, each thread needs a stack. Why?","width":320},{"text":"Well we're calling functions. We have to put those automatic variables somewhere.","width":192},{"text":"And, when we return from a function, we have to remember where we're going to go back to. So again, that goes on the stack.","width":384},{"text":"So for each thread there is a stack and we have three threads in our process.","width":512},{"text":"So if my code called created twice, that means I could be doing three things at the same time.","width":448},{"text":"Ok, so I've been talking about processes for quite a bit, and talking about threads. What are some of the differences between them?","width":640},{"text":"Which is bigger?","width":128},{"text":"A process, yes. How much bigger?","width":384},{"text":"It's HUGE! Our process is a massive object!","width":192},{"text":"It's got file descriptors. It's got a big virtual memory space.","width":448},{"text":"Threads are tiny. they live inside a process.","width":256},{"text":"If you killed a process, that's it for all of your threads. They don't have anywhere to run anymore.","width":512},{"text":"So your process represents the sandbox. Everything that your threads can do will live inside a process.","width":448},{"text":"So our process has security.","width":448},{"text":"It's got virtual memory.","width":128},{"text":"It's got an exit status.","width":256},{"text":"Threads live inside a process, and they just represent what you want the CPU to do.","width":576},{"text":"They represent the code, the position in the code that is currently being executed.","width":512},{"text":"So that means if you kill a process, ha ha that's it. All of your threads are done.","width":256},{"text":"So if you send, say, an alarm signal to your process, all of your threads will disappear.","width":640},{"text":"If the process disappears, all of them have gone. This is an important point. They just live inside.","width":576},{"text":"So if we've created all these threads, perhaps we want to stop them.","width":320},{"text":"Guess what, you can do that and here's what you'd call. You'd call pthread_cancel.","width":448},{"text":"Let's have a look at pthread_cancel.","width":192},{"text":"How could I cancel a thread?","width":192},{"text":"Easy, just send in that id that we got from pthread_create and you can cancel a thread.","width":512},{"text":"I don't want to spend too much time on this because, in practice, no one bothers to use this.","width":448},{"text":"Here's why. Imagine you are making a fantastic meal for Friday night your potential boyfriend, girlfriend, dog is coming over,","width":832},{"text":"and your cooking like a storm here. And then suddenly, BAM! your activity is cancelled.","width":384},{"text":"The kitchen is in complete disarray. It hasn't been cleaned up. What a mess!","width":320},{"text":"It's extremely rare that we can just cancel something and not have to clean things up.","width":320},{"text":"So what examples might we have.","width":128},{"text":"Well let's say you have a thread that's kind of calculating new digits of pi, or discovering prime numbers,","width":576},{"text":"or trying to mine bitcoins like you've come up with a new currency called CS241coins or something.","width":448},{"text":"You can probably cancel that. It was just a CPU intensive job.","width":256},{"text":"But if there's any kind of resources, then maybe we shouldn't just call this cancel and leave everything in disarray.","width":448},{"text":"So in practice what we tend to do, actually make a variable to tell our threads, \"Oh by the way, you should stop at some point.\"","width":576},{"text":"And if you call this pthread_cancel, things don't even stop immediately.","width":256},{"text":"Typically they will stop when that particular thread makes a system call, like open or read.","width":384},{"text":"We can discover all of the calls just by looking at the man pages.","width":256},{"text":"So this will be like the moment that your chef opens the oven door we say, ","width":320},{"text":"\"ok, you're out of here, we've quit you, we've cancelled you, no more work for you.\"","width":320},{"text":"So what a mess. We don't tend to do that.","width":192},{"text":"So let's write something that can be cancelled.","width":320},{"text":"We want to call pthread_create. What do we pass in? A pointer to our little identifier.","width":320},{"text":"We don't need any parameters. What's next? Oh yes, the function.","width":320},{"text":"I called it my funct, and an initial value.

  [{"text":"Alright, so, this little function can say initially we are going to just sleep for one second","width":704},{"text":"and then put something like \"HI!\".","width":128},{"text":"Ok, right, so its gonna print \"HI!\"","width":192},{"text":"So, now, I've got a program that is going to use two CPU's, if I have two CPU's.","width":384},{"text":"Uh oh, what happens if I only have one CPU?","width":384},{"text":"The scheduler!  The Linux Kernel is going to say \"okay, you get access to the CPU for say 10 milliseconds or 100 milliseconds","width":704},{"text":"and after that amount of time, I'm going to take you off the CPU and let the other thread use it.","width":448},{"text":"And if we do this faster enough, like 10 milliseconds or so","width":192},{"text":"then those slow humans will never notice, that actually only one thread at a time is on each CPU core","width":576},{"text":"And if it turns out that you make a system call like \"open\" or \"read\" and it takes time for us to read that stuff from the disk","width":448},{"text":"Then you don't need the CPU because you are waiting for stuff so I can give the CPU to someone else.","width":256},{"text":"So the scheduler has to make those decisions and make them well.","width":256},{"text":"Ok, so for example this sleep, you don't need any CPU to sleep.  I can let another thread use that.","width":448},{"text":"So, what were we going to do here...","width":192},{"text":"Oh yes, let's change this so we can cancel our little \"HI\" function.","width":192},{"text":"We'll sleep for 3 seconds here and then change to something like \"please_stop\".","width":448},{"text":"And then I will just loop forever.","width":256},{"text":"So, what do were want to do here?  We want to say \"while (!please_stop)\" keep going around.","width":448},{"text":"And finally, let's have a global variable...there we go.","width":320},{"text":"We know in C that our global variables are initialized to zero.","width":256},{"text":"Let's run this and see what mistakes we made.","width":128},{"text":"(waiting)","width":576},{"text":"Ok, alright.

you're not going to let anybody else own it","width":199},{"text":"very objective thing","width":152},{"text":"it's mine, I'm jealous","width":113},{"text":"don't let if you are holding a mutex, you don't want anybody else","width":254},{"text":"any other thread to try to lock that mutex","width":276},{"text":"if they do they have to wait until you've finished with it","width":454},{"text":"now

lecture","width":586},{"text":"alright, so, let's have a look to see how we can do this, what we'd like to do is around this critical section we'd like to lock a mutex and afterwords we'd like to unlock it","width":895},{"text":"unlocking doesn't take anytime at all","width":118},{"text":"locking usually doesn't take anytime at all unless somebody else has locked the same

twiddle your thumbs","width":461},{"text":"in fact you might actually use up a bit of CPU time while still twiddiling thumbs, it's often called a spin lock","width":415},{"text":"which is how this thing is implemented underneath but we don't need to talk about that","width":230},{"text":"but essentially we've got a little piece of code that says ok, i have to wait i have to wait i have to wait i ahve to wait until the mutex lock has been unlocked","width":606},{"text":"but they're designed to be efficient for when you want to lock them and unlock them in the very near future","width":468},{"text":"so let's actually have a look at the code for that, how do we do that?","width":207},{"text":"we'll it's part of the pthread library","width":119},{"text":"and we can say I've got a pthread_mutex, here it is, it's a pthread_mutex_t type","width":525},{"text":"and I'll just call it my mutex one","width":360},{"text":"so now we want to lock it","width":182},{"text":"how can I possibly write that code if pthread_mutex_lock()","width":291},{"text":"what do I need to give it? the address of the mutex","width":280},{"text":"and guess how I unlock

speed I think it returned","width":504},{"text":"OK, heres, here's to the first surprise, it shouldn't have worked","width":448},{"text":"[laughs]","width":142},{"text":"it appeared to work, but that's just lulling us into a false sense of security","width":392},{"text":"the second surprise is that it took a bit longer","width":221},{"text":"so at least I'm sorry I took the loop down by an order of magnitude yet it still took a long time","width":427},{"text":"so this is a not free the lock and unlock are not free, it takes a certain amount of time","width":298},{"text":"especially if you look at how much overhead we're doing in this example","width":186},{"text":"we're just incrementing and getting them out of a loop. so they don't take a small amount of time to run","width":548},{"text":"the second thing is that they may not work if you've forgotten to initialize them","width":280},{"text":"and this time for a lecture demonstration i was unlucky that it did work","width":254},{"text":"what we should do is make sure that our mutex locks are properly initialized","width":338},{"text":"alright, so how can I do that?","width":127},{"text":"well before using them we should call pthread_mutex_init","width":437},{"text":"and let's look at the man page","width":275},{"text":"we can pass in a pointer to our mutex as some attribrutes if we'd like as

","width":288},{"text":"and we saw that if we let two threads access that global variable","width":296},{"text":"then our count will be wrong","width":190},{"text":"and so our messing around reading or writing that piece of data we solve the problem via putting a mutex lock around it","width":658},{"text":"and we said okay right but if we do that then only one thread can continue and change that variable","width":404},{"text":"and the other one has to wait","width":111},{"text":"so what we did is we identified a critical section of our code","width":292},{"text":"where only one thread or one process can manipulate that memory at a time","width":409},{"text":"so what we're going to do now is step back from thinking about mutexes and locks and think about it in terms of some pseudocode and also think about what happens might you implement say mutex lock and mutex unlock","width":853},{"text":"and that is what we're going to do","width":110},{"text":"right so here we go","width":160},{"text":"it turns out for example that someone forgot to implement mutex lock and unlock","width":464},{"text":"and so, here's my idea of how we could actually implement those two functions","width":558},{"text":"okay so remember the game here is that if two threads called lock only one of them should win","width":558},{"text":"and the other one has to wait","width":153},{"text":"it's the you know any one person in the bathroom at a time type of rule here","width":231},{"text":"so how's the code work?","width":197},{"text":"right so when you call it you pass in a pointer to this mutex object inside that data structure I've got something called lock","width":539},{"text":"which can just be an int","width":164},{"text":"so if someone else has already entered, in other words, if they have already set the lock","width":310},{"text":"then my code does nothing","width":182},{"text":"it just goes around and says okay is it unlocked now is it unlocked now is it unlocked now is it unlocked now?","width":393},{"text":"so it's going to busy wait, it's going to just keep testing that variable","width":345},{"text":"once it's unlocked, my little thread is going to say okay great","width":350},{"text":"now I can set the lock","width":294},{"text":"that means if any other thread at this point tries to lock it, they are going to have to wait","width":294},{"text":"they are going to be inside that busy loop because I still have the lock","width":258},{"text":"and of course eventually when my code finishes I can then just immediately set it back to zero","width":368},{"text":"I don't need to have any loops here, I know that I'm the only thread that could of set this lock","width":407},{"text":"so the code is simple, just unlock the door and walk out","width":309},{"text":"right so that's my first attempt at protecting my critical code, my critical section","width":522},{"text":"so that's my first implementation of how lock and unlock might work","width":336},{"text":"is it any good though?","width":112},{"text":"will it work?","width":87},{"text":"perhaps you and your neighbor can figure out why this proposed code is actually not sufficient ","width":603},{"text":"what race conditions could you see? what would happen if two threads happen to call it at about the same time?","width":392},{"text":"so here's what we have to do, you have to look at that code with two parts of your brain","width":241},{"text":"and imagine two different threads were running the same code","width":335},{"text":"what could happen that would be bad?","width":217},{"text":"[pause]","width":5190},{"text":"okay so what have we discovered?","width":210},{"text":"is this implementation any good?","width":454},{"text":"what do you think?","width":131},{"text":"no, why not?","width":644},{"text":"no okay too scary, alright","width":292},{"text":"so here's our problem, our lock needs a lock","width":206},{"text":"there's a potential race condition here","width":106},{"text":"what would happen if two threads called lock at about the same time","width":258},{"text":"both of them would see that the door is unlocked","width":255},{"text":"yes? both of them would see that the variable is zero. great they say, I don't need to be inside my while loop anymore and they continue","width":452},{"text":"at the same time","width":83},{"text":"so now they both set the lock equal to one and they both return, they both continue","width":335},{"text":"so both of them, both threads are now able to enter the critical section","width":364},{"text":"which is precisely what we didn't want","width":168},{"text":"we wanted to make sure that only one thread at a time could escape from our lock","width":809},{"text":"does that make sense?","width":199},{"text":"because this is the easy one, this lecture is designed to blow your mind","width":634},{"text":"and to make new connections that didn't exist","width":155},{"text":"this stuff is really hard to think about if you have a human brain","width":367}],

easy, make a lock, oh wait that's what I'm trying to do right?","width":203},{"text":"so that's not going to work for us","width":138},{"text":"okay so that failed, what we failed at was mutual exclusion","width":583},{"text":"we only want one thread or process if you're talking historically inside our critical section","width":1154},{"text":"so let's try a different solution, let's try our first real candidate solution","width":499},{"text":"we'll have um. we'll agree on the following","width":159},{"text":"now before you panic, the code written out here, the pseudocode is the same as the pseudocode on the right hand side","width":430},{"text":"the reason we wrote it twice is because I want you to think about two threads or two processes trying to execute this at the same time","width":439},{"text":"and see if we can actually kind of prevent bad things from happening","width":194},{"text":"so what we'll do is we'll have some flags","width":239},{"text":"we'll say look, I'm going to just wait until your flag is lowered","width":404},{"text":"and your thread will do the same","width":379},{"text":"so if I see that your flag is up, then I know that you are inside the critical section","width":752},{"text":"in which case I'm just going to wait","width":398},{"text":"once I decide that your flag is down, I'm going to raise my flag, I can do my stuff and then I'll lower my flag","width":435},{"text":"now we can say what happens if I have three or four or five or more threads in this, let's not","width":327},{"text":"let's just worry about what happens with just two threads or two processes trying to do that","width":314},{"text":"this is hard enough with just two","width":136},{"text":"alright so does this work, does this suffer from the same problem?","width":270},{"text":"or not?","width":66},{"text":"okay you decide and see if you can argue it with your neighbor","width":480},{"text":"[silence]","width":3168},{"text":"okay! so, does it work? yes it does great, end of lecture","width":321},{"text":"no of course it doesn't work","width":120},{"text":"right? so does it work? no! why not?","width":475},{"text":"let's hear from someone over here, yes","width":559},{"text":"they both could be waiting forever, uhhhhhhh, I think that might be hard, I think we can assume that their flags are initially down","width":801},{"text":"alright so how will they get to have both of them up?","width":420},{"text":"come on keep going","width":795},{"text":"alright so we have a potential problem right? yes that both people or both threads could see each other and say oh look his flag is down","width":731},{"text":"great I can continue, at which point we raise our flag and say alright off I go","width":309},{"text":"and they do this at exactly the same time, or about the same time","width":540},{"text":"so hey i'm going to wait until your flag is lowered and I'm going to wait until your flag is lowered","width":344},{"text":"they check each others flags they are both low so they can both proceed","width":302},{"text":"they raise their flags to say okay I'm going in","width":164},{"text":"but it's too late, they've both gotten past this little loop!","width":189},{"text":"so they both go into the critical section so what we have failed on the mutual exclusion principle game again","width":700},{"text":"we did not get mutual exclusion","width":123},{"text":"we wanted one person inside our critical section at a time thank you very much and we failed","width":511},{"text":"so when we're looking at these solutions, we've got to evaluate them a little bit carefully because it can happen more than once","width":438},{"text":"you could imagine you're going to wrap this around some data structure update like hey I want to add something to my linked list","width":344},{"text":"or add something to my hash","width":109},{"text":"and I don't know where I'm going to do it but I do know I'm going to say insert things into my hash or read my hash multiple times","width":647},{"text":"right so, let's be sneaky, let's be guided by what we did before","width":324},{"text":"and this time we're going to raise our flag first","width":266},{"text":"that way hopefully, we can stop this mutual exclusion problem","width":280},{"text":"okay what's wrong with this solution, right so again the code here is the same as this code here","width":351},{"text":"you could just imagine that this is person A and person B or thread A and thread B","width":252},{"text":"what happens now?

  [{"text":"okay, right, so, now, this is where you come in","width":192},{"text":"remember how I said, OSX doesn't implement semaphores. well guess what, it's your lucky day,!","width":512},{"text":"you are at Apple and in the afternoon, they accidentally left you access to the source code so you decided to actually implement sem_wait sem_post ecetera for Apple so we can actually get these things working","width":1024},{"text":"alright, and we can use condition variables. condition variables are more general, they're more powerful than semaphores because we get to write any condition that we want inside the little while loop","width":640},{"text":"so, how would you write these things? okay, how do we implement our semaphores?","width":448},{"text":"okay, so what do we need inside our semaphore?","width":192},{"text":"well, we need some sort of count","width":192},{"text":"to remember when that count gets to zero, then our sem_wait will wait","width":384},{"text":"and presumably, we also need some sort of pthread_mutex_lock","width":384},{"text":"there we go. and we'll have a pthread_cond variable","width":320},{"text":"there we go","width":320},{"text":"so with both things inside our semaphore, now we can figure out how to write sem_wait and sem_post","width":640},{"text":"so, what's the first thing we should do inside sem_wait?","width":1664},{"text":"we're going to be accessing our count variable so before we do that, we want to make sure that we have sole access. exclusive access to it. alright. so what should we call first?","width":960},{"text":"yes! let's lock our mutex","width":128},{"text":"alright, so, pthread_mutex_lock, and passed in a pointer to that structure so we'll do s, get the lock","width":640},{"text":"um, we'll make these little pointers just for speed today. right, and at the very end, we are gonna unlock stuff as well","width":704},{"text":"so, when did we need to actually meditate? when did we actually need to pause?","width":960},{"text":"so if the count is zero, then let's send this monk to sleep. let's send this thread to sleep. so now we can call pthread_cond_wait","width":1280},{"text":"and you'd pass in a pointer to the condition variable and a pointer to the mutex","width":512},{"text":"and remember, that does three things for you. it unlocks the mutex, sleeps on the condition variable, and when eventually where it wakes up from that meditation, it's going to relock the mutex before returning","width":960},{"text":"so one way to look at this code is that inside this code, at all times, the mutex lock is actually locked in terms of the code that we writing. in terms of say, checking this count.","width":704},{"text":"we know that that mutex lock is always locked","width":192},{"text":"it's only if it actually goes to sleep inside this cond_wait will the mutex lock become unlocked","width":576},{"text":"alright so, we get around there. and the last thing we need to do in our wait call is to reduce the count","width":512},{"text":"so, in our count structure, reduce it","width":512},{"text":"what would happen if two threads called sem_wait at the same time? doesn't matter. our lock would ensure that only one of them wins.","width":640},{"text":"that only one of them executes at a time","width":128},{"text":"so maybe the first thread will successfully call sem_wait and continue. the second thread, though, calling sem_wait might see the count value zero and then it's forced to meditate","width":704},{"text":"alright, what about our post? our post is not going to do any sleeping.","width":384},{"text":"it will increment the count","width":320},{"text":"okay, oh! look at that! I've touched part of the structure. I better make sure that what?","width":512},{"text":"what should I have done first?","width":128},{"text":"get the lock! yes.","width":128},{"text":"okay, so pthread_mutex_lock and pass in a pointer to the lock that everyone's playing with","width":448},{"text":"there we go","width":64},{"text":"so now I know when I get back from this that I've got exclusive access to this data structure because all the code I'm writing always locks the same lock","width":832},{"text":"and now, I can call pthread_cond_signal","width":512},{"text":"on the condition variable","width":512},{"text":"and finally, unlock the mutex. so this code would work","width":512},{"text":"but we can do a little bit better","width":192},{"text":"which is that our post is always asking the operating system to find a sleeping monk and ring the bell","width":640},{"text":"and, we could do a little bit better reasoning about this, we can say well hold on, the only time that there could be a sleeping monk is if the count is actually already been reduced to zero","width":832},{"text":"so if I've just incremented the count, then I'm going to wake up one monk","width":320},{"text":"so if the count has just been incremented to one, now I know that I should try to wake up a monk. if there happens to be no monks waiting, doesn't matter. that's okay, that's not my problem","width":1024},{"text":"but for the other times, if count says greater than one, then there can't have been any monks waiting. there's only going to be monks waiting if we've reduced the count down to one.","width":768},{"text":"alright and in here we write the standard code to initialize our mutex lock and our condition variable","width":512},{"text":"okay, and with that, we're out of time!

  [{"text":"Apparently my head cold managed to confuse me so therefore I confused you","width":832},{"text":"and I gave you an incorrect delta to those examples to show you peterson's solution","width":534},{"text":"and what I did was incomplete","width":128},{"text":"this is peterson's solution","width":169},{"text":"it is in the book, the wiki book","width":229},{"text":"the wiki book is very new ","width":124},{"text":"I only started creating it last semester","width":192},{"text":"it is an experiment to say what would happen if I after every lecture I wrote some notes","width":360},{"text":"and rather than just put it in a pdf, actually make it a wiki page","width":197},{"text":"so the wiki book is yours to edit and to add to eventually we'll actually turn it into a hard copy and I'll charge eight hundred thousand dollars for each one","width":768},{"text":"right no I'm not going to give it to Peterson or any of those other vulture companies","width":305},{"text":"I'll eventually have a hard copy and basically sell it at a bit over cost","width":359},{"text":"but until we do that it is available on the web","width":192},{"text":"you too can edit it, you too can improve it","width":192},{"text":"and in fact i'll be talking partly about that on Friday","width":247},{"text":"there is a conference where we talk about educational technologies and I've got a talk about that","width":430},{"text":"and also about the linux in the browser project which you too can play with","width":344},{"text":"and it's all in the cs 241 home page and you too can help develop it if you wish","width":379},{"text":"so i have several people doing improvements on that project as part of their senior projects for example","width":452},{"text":"I also have another group adding subtitles, captions to lecture videos","width":446},{"text":"and are looking at crowdsourcing for that","width":128},{"text":"so lots of good stuff","width":111},{"text":"right so we've talked about that","width":192},{"text":"i'll tell you about some more news in a little bit","width":154},{"text":"right now let's turn our attention to today's little challenge here","width":569},{"text":"the first challenge is relatively easy","width":135},{"text":"but it's still nontrivial","width":128},{"text":"what we're going to do today is make a barrier","width":457},{"text":"so we talked about okay we can create all these threads","width":217},{"text":"and one way to program them would be to say create a whole lot of threads which work on a little problem and join on all of those threads and we wait for them to finish","width":538},{"text":"that's a perfectly reasonable and simple way to use threads","width":192},{"text":"but we can do better","width":119},{"text":"now that we know that we've got these primitives that can stop and wait","width":331},{"text":"we can make our threads wait for each other ","width":244},{"text":"so before going to a part b of an algorithm","width":259},{"text":"let's wait for everybody to finish part a","width":222},{"text":"so this is basically like before closing the door of an elevator and going down to the next part","width":298},{"text":"we want all of our other threads to finish","width":185},{"text":"so that's the idea of a barrier","width":128},{"text":"we can implement this using semaphores and we can say that we're going to look at using condition variables","width":576},{"text":"so remember what is a condition variable? it's nothing particularly special","width":198},{"text":"it just allows our threads to go into a meditative state and not use any cpu until we wake it up","width":400},{"text":"but it's called a condition variable because we've put this inside the loop that tests for some condition","width":712},{"text":"so let's look at our little story here and see what we can do here","width":519},{"text":"there we go","width":193},{"text":"right so I've set up a typical little problem here that hey I've got a lot of data here it is","width":616},{"text":"a big array","width":188},{"text":"it's in global memory so that makes life easy","width":187},{"text":"and I've got a calculation I want to do on it","width":256},{"text":"fortunately I know about threads so I'm going to split my big array up here into chunks","width":680},{"text":"and if I've got two hundred and fifty six blocks why don't I split it up into sixteen chunks","width":917},{"text":"for my oops I'm just looking down here if my x so this is now x and this is now y, nevermind","width":553},{"text":"so my x values are going to be rather than one thread going from zero to two hundred and fifty five","width":648},{"text":"I'm going to get each thread to work independently on a segment of this matrix","width":477},{"text":"alright so if we have a look at this ","width":192},{"text":"this is what we've got here","width":108},{"text":"in my main I'm going to fire off N threads","width":385},{"text":"okay so we'll define N to be say sixteen","width":410},{"text":"wouldn't it be nice to have a sixteen core processor","width":160},{"text":"well you too can right now either just spend a lot of money or wait three years and it'll be easy","width":539},{"text":"so it'll be cheap","width":51},{"text":"so then we'll start say 16 threads","width":271},{"text":"I want to ask each one of them to do a chunk of the work","width":165},{"text":"one sixteenth of the total amount of work","width":302},{"text":"okay so great we've called pthread_create","width":340},{"text":"what's the first argument we pass into pthread_create?","width":430},{"text":"yes we are actually going to pass in the address of that","width":253},{"text":"the address of where we want pthread_create to store the the thread identifier","width":297},{"text":"so how do I write that","width":105},{"text":"I could say ampersand okay here's my little array and I want the i one","width":477},{"text":"that's probably the most readable way of writing that","width":192},{"text":"an equivalent would be to say ids + i","width":438},{"text":"is that true? so think about that or test it","width":1066},{"text":"part of it becomes what's the size of this","width":154},{"text":"what happens when you add to it","width":193},{"text":"I'm not going to write that today","width":84},{"text":"I'm going to go with this","width":69},{"text":"right so we've got the address of where we want to store that identifier","width":385},{"text":"we don't need to set any special parameters for our pthread_create","width":174},{"text":"we're going to pass in this calc function that actually does all the work for us and finally we say (void*) i","width":361},{"text":"right so what are we doing here we're taking that little integer and we're turning it into a pointer","width":320},{"text":"you can that in C, remember it's just a bit pattern being converted into a similar bit pattern but we're saying that the type of it should be treated as a (void *) pointer","width":704},{"text":"why do I that, that's because that's the argument type","width":192},{"text":"and that will be okay provided we don't actually try to follow that pointer into memory","width":320},{"text":"remember it's just a value 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 15","width":320},{"text":"okay so at the end of here I'm going to wait for my threads to finish","width":355},{"text":"okay so here I'm just going to call pthread_join and this time pass in the value of my little identifiers","width":623},{"text":"and I don't actually care about the exit value","width":287},{"text":"otherwise I could have passed in a pointer to a void * to grab that","width":294},{"text":"and then I would write some code to print out the result which I don't care about","width":192},{"text":"so that's the outside of my algorithm, start all these threads, off you go, sixteen people start doing your work","width":389},{"text":"I'm going to give each one of you a unique number and then wait for them to all finish by calling pthread_join","width":585},{"text":"now the main part of this puzzle starts","width":172},{"text":"okay we're going to write our little calc program","width":300},{"text":"we know that our pthread functions take a void* and return a void*","width":827},{"text":"so I've got some pointer, I don't actually want to use that variable as a pointer though","width":275},{"text":"I just want to cast it back into an integer","width":466},{"text":"so no memory lookups were used in this casting ","width":221},{"text":"it simply says hey I know you treat me as a pointer, I lied I just want to treat it as an integer","width":384},{"text":"and I went through those hoops just to make the compiler happy","width":421},{"text":"and I'm confident that a void* pointer can hold the integer between zero and fifteen","width":294},{"text":"right so that's going to be my starting point","width":169},{"text":"my end point exclusive would just be the starting point plus sixteen","width":295},{"text":"so now in my little loop x can go form the start almost to the end and my y is going to go through all of the remaining 8192 entries","width":772},{"text":"right and then I do my calculation","width":128},{"text":"that's going to take a while","width":84},{"text":"now you might say really all sixteen threads are going to run at the same time so they are all going to finish at the same time","width":407},{"text":"well that's not quite true","width":222},{"text":"it could be that one of these threads starts very very late","width":312},{"text":"it could be another thread starts completely earlier ","width":128},{"text":"it depends on how the operating system decides to schedule these threads","width":221},{"text":"it could be that a cpu is temporarily stolen to do some other work","width":280},{"text":"like process an interrupt because you pressed something on the keyboard","width":179},{"text":"something arrived on the network","width":105},{"text":"something arrived from the disk","width":75},{"text":"so you're not guaranteed to have the CPU for 100% of the time","width":265},{"text":"so we're not quite sure when all of these threads are going to finish","width":204},{"text":"so that's where we come in now","width":85},{"text":"we're going to try and write some code in here so that we can make sure that we don't continue the second calculation until all sixteen threads have finished","width":798},{"text":"so what are you going to do","width":153},{"text":"how are we going to solve this?","width":199},{"text":"what do we need?","width":442},{"text":"I need some ideas","width":318},{"text":"we could potentially do this with a semaphore","width":175},{"text":"kind of, what other ways could we do this though?","width":556},{"text":"okay yes we need some sort of global count variable","width":146},{"text":"just keep track of how many threads are currently running","width":269},{"text":"we're not going to try and directly query these threads","width":222},{"text":"we'll just have some sort of global variable that all the threads can decrement to say oh yeah I finished","width":668},{"text":"okay so up here we'll have an int remain and we can set that equal to sixteen","width":587},{"text":"or N if we want to","width":498},{"text":"so when I actually finish my work, each thread will decrement remain","width":950},{"text":"now notice what I just said","width":44},{"text":"when each thread finishes, it is going to decrement remain","width":161},{"text":"at this point, alarm bells should go off","width":328},{"text":"okay very quiet ones inside your head","width":192},{"text":"because I've just said that more than one thread is touching a data structure","width":320},{"text":"so there's a potential race condition","width":143},{"text":"two threads might decide to decrement remain at the same time","width":185},{"text":"whoops we don't want that","width":78},{"text":"we want each thread to have exclusive access to this remain","width":260},{"text":"when it's actually manipulating that","width":105},{"text":"so how do we ensure that happens","width":152},{"text":"yes bring out your mutex lock","width":456},{"text":"maybe it looks like a giant padlock or anyways nevermind","width":347},{"text":"so yeah we'll call pthread_mutex_lock on our mutex","width":640},{"text":"okay so this takes a pointer to that data structure","width":326},{"text":"at this point alarm bells go off and say oh hey did I actually remember to initialize the mutex","width":334},{"text":"and the answer is yes yeah you did if you actually managed to write the correct function","width":382},{"text":"these are pthread_mutex_init is one way to initialize your mutex lock","width":308},{"text":"right so if we do a lock, we know that any other thread that comes in here has to wait","width":459},{"text":"it could be then that those other threads that have not yet finished","width":490},{"text":"in which case the thread that is running this code ","width":169},{"text":"we want it to go to sleep","width":77},{"text":"okay well let's suppose I didn't know about condition variables","width":356},{"text":"then I might say something like while remain is greater than zero","width":504},{"text":"do nothing","width":250},{"text":"wohahahahaha we laugh at that code wohaahaha","width":171},{"text":"why? because we do know about condition variables, but why else?","width":501},{"text":"yeah the first thread that gets in there is just going to spin around","width":448},{"text":"and round and round and round it goes","width":145},{"text":"the second thread when it finishes will attempt to lock the mutex","width":289},{"text":"are you prepared to wait? yes i'm prepared to wait","width":171},{"text":"right then the second thread that finishes will get stuck inside pthread_mutex_lock","width":248},{"text":"waiting to lock that mutex, but we can see from this code that that mutex lock is never unlocked","width":313},{"text":"the second, third, fourth and fifth and the remaining fifteen threads will never get past pthread_mutex_lock","width":455},{"text":"because that mutex lock is never unlocked wohahahah","width":232},{"text":"alright so how can we start fixing this code","width":322},{"text":"well here's what we are going to do","width":79},{"text":"rather than just having a busy loop where we continuously burn up CPU time","width":298},{"text":"we are going to call pthread_condition_wait","width":561},{"text":"and for that you pass in your condition variable and pass in a pointer to your mutex lock","width":494},{"text":"and every good systems programmer knows that is when your thread meditates","width":410},{"text":"it goes to sleep","width":255},{"text":"but before it goes to sleep what happens?","width":310},{"text":"what do you get inside here?","width":194},{"text":"for free, what's it do for you?","width":207},{"text":"hint, we have to pass in the pointer to the mutex","width":166},{"text":"why? because it's going to unlock that mutex for you","width":287},{"text":"and then go to sleep","width":192},{"text":"alright so one of our threads arrived here early and said \"look remain is still non zero, I'm just going to sit here and chillax\"","width":783},{"text":"yeah i'm not going to do anything, I'm just going to go into my meditative state","width":384},{"text":"the very last thread, the sixteenth thread that comes in says \"oh look remain is finally zero, I don't need to sleep, I can continue!\"","width":835},{"text":"so I'll unlock and off we go","width":298},{"text":"and the sixteenth thread to arrive will then do the second calculation","width":347},{"text":"right so that's not a very good barrier right?","width":436},{"text":"what do we do? we wait until the sixteenth sheep finally arrives that was enough weight to tip the balance and the sixteenth sheep could continue","width":576},{"text":"and all the others are left there waiting, sleeping, yes?","width":319},{"text":"we'd like a way to wake up those meditating threads","width":354},{"text":"how do we do that?","width":214},{"text":"yes broadcast, we want to not just wake up one sleeping thread with a little bell, ding","width":615},{"text":"right, if you call pthread_condition_signal the system will choose one arbitrary sleeping thread and wake it up","width":713},{"text":"we don't want to do that, we want to wake up everybody","width":300},{"text":"so this is like running over to FARPAR and shouting free ice cream right? everybody comes over","width":545},{"text":"actually any free food at FARPAR will work but so","width":244},{"text":"how can we do this? well here's what we'll do","width":263},{"text":"inside our code, we need to call broadcast","width":346},{"text":"now I could do it even before the while loop here","width":371},{"text":"I could say \"okay pthread_condition_broadcast\" and here's the way we're going to wake up, anybody who is sleeping on this particular conditional variable","width":993},{"text":"now will this work? yes, here's what happens","width":297},{"text":"you wake up everybody in FARPAR and they check and discover that actually there is no ice cream so they just go back to sleep","width":530},{"text":"okay so that's a silly analogy, but what happens in the code is that we wake up everybody inside the condition wait and see look we wrote it inside a while loop","width":544},{"text":"so everybody wakes up, eventually they get to run on the CPU, and when they do they'll say \"oh look remain is actually still greater than zero\"","width":555},{"text":"so this code will keep waking up every time a thread gets to this point, it would run it","width":301},{"text":"so we could do a bit better than that","width":111},{"text":"we actually don't want to always wake people, we actually only want to call this when we know that if remain is now zero, actually bother to wake people up","width":1244},{"text":"alright so if I'm the last person in the gate, wake everybody up","width":271},{"text":"there's no point in waking other people up beforehand because they will simply check and discover that remain is actually still non zero and then just go back to sleep","width":601},{"text":"so that would work, it's just not that efficient","width":250},{"text":"this is more efficient, don't wake people up until remain is zero","width":575},{"text":"so that is a barrier, yes at the back?","width":809},{"text":"well the last thread will see the value of zero so you'll never actually go into this while loop","width":297},{"text":"yes I could have written it afterwards, it's still a good idea to do the broadcast inside the lock and unlock","width":643},{"text":"there's a subtle race condition we can get if we don't","width":373},{"text":"right and the other thing to remember is that condition wait actually does three things","width":369},{"text":"after being woken up from its deep sleep, before it returns, it waits to acquire the mutex lock again","width":635},{"text":"so that means you've woken people up but they won't actually start to execute this code","width":349},{"text":"they won't be checking the remain value until someone exits","width":326},{"text":"until someone unlocks the

continue on this code yet because we're still holding the mutex lock","width":510},{"text":"so eventually we unlock and then another thread in here will say great!","width":257},{"text":"finally I've woken up and finally I've managed to lock the mutex thread and I can continue","width":266},{"text":"and what's it do? it just unlocks the mutex and continues","width":203},{"text":"and so on and so on for the remaining threads","width":265},{"text":"so this is really really powerful","width":128},{"text":"this is a very very powerful paradigm now because now you can make your threads do a whole lot of work, pause for each other, wait for each other and then continue to do more work, etc","width":575},{"text":"now you can write pretty good performant code in a way that you couldn't before","width":481},{"text":"okay any other questions?","width":173},{"text":"I'll give you a hint, I like to do things like show you code and say on an exam or quiz and say \"well okay does this actually work? is it efficient or not? or when might it break?\"","width":906},{"text":"so you could imagine for example if we only did signal here instead of broadcast, we'd only be waking up one thread","width":479},{"text":"and the other fourteen of them would still be sleeping","width":561},{"text":"aha right so when we come to test this, A will be compiled so let's fix what you said","width":581},{"text":"pthread_cond_t there we go and then when we come to test it, it doesn't work","width":611},{"text":"what did we forget to do?","width":128},{"text":"initialize it, yes! remember with these things, we've actually got two steps","width":343},{"text":"you've got to A. make some memory somewhere of enough size and B. actually call init on it","width":414},{"text":"so inside here we need to do pthread_cond_init and if we were writing robust code, that's a null as well, we would check the return values of these","width":1555}],
